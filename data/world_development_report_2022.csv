,,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the largest global economic crisis in more than a,,
"century. In 2020, economic activity contracted in 90 percent of countries, the world",,
"economy shrank by about 3 percent, and global poverty increased for the ﬁrst time",,
"in a generation. Governments responded rapidly with ﬁscal, monetary, and ﬁnancial",,
policies that alleviated the worst immediate economic impacts of the crisis. Yet the,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT,
world must still contend with the signiﬁcant longer-term ﬁnancial and economic,,
"risks caused by, or exacerbated by, the pandemic and the government responses needed",,
to mitigate its eﬀects.,,
World Development Report 2022: Finance for an Equitable Recovery examines the central,,
role of ﬁnance in the economic recovery from COVID-19. Based on an in-depth,,
look at the consequences of the crisis most likely to aﬀect low- and middle-income,,
"economies, it advocates a set of policies and measures to mitigate the interconnected",,
economic risks stemming from the pandemic—risks that may become more acute,,
as stimulus measures are withdrawn at both the domestic and global levels. Those,,
policies include the efficient and transparent management of nonperforming loans,,
"to mitigate threats to ﬁnancial stability, insolvency reforms to allow for the orderly",,
"reduction of unsustainable debts, innovations in risk management and lending models",,
"to ensure continued access to credit for households and businesses, and improvements",,
in sovereign debt management to preserve the ability of governments to support an,,
equitable recovery.,FINANCE FOR AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY,FINANCE

Foreword,,,,,,,,,,,
This new World Development Report focuses on the interrelated economic risks that house-,,,,,,,,,,,
"holds, businesses, ﬁnancial institutions, and governments worldwide are facing as a con-",,,,,,,,,,,
sequence of the COVID-19 crisis. The Report oﬀers new insights from research on the,,,,,,,,,,,
interconnectedness of balance sheets and the potential spillover eﬀects across sectors. It,,,,,,,,,,,
"also oﬀers policy recommendations based on these insights. Speciﬁcally, it addresses the",,,,,,,,,,,
question of how to reduce the ﬁnancial risks stemming from the extraordinary policies,,,,,,,,,,,
adopted in response to the COVID-19 crisis while supporting an equitable recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,
"The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has already led to millions of deaths, job losses,",,,,,,,,,,,
"business failures, and school closings, triggering the most encompassing economic crisis ",,,,,,,,,,,
in almost a century. Poverty rates have soared and inequality has widened both across,,,,,,,,,,,
and within countries. Disadvantaged groups that had limited ﬁnancial resilience to begin ,,,,,,,,,,,
with and workers with lower levels of education—especially younger ones and women—,,,,,,,,,,,
have been disproportionately aﬀected.,,,,,,,,,,,
"The response by governments has included a combination of cash transfers to households,",,,,,,,,,,,
"credit guarantees for ﬁrms, easier liquidity conditions, repayment grace periods for much of",,,,,,,,,,,
"the private sector, and accounting and regulatory forbearance for many ﬁnancial institu-",,,,,,,,,,,
tions. Although these actions have helped to partially mitigate the economic and social con-,,,,,,,,,,,
"sequences of the pandemic, they have also resulted in elevated risks, including public over-",,,,,,,,,,,
"indebtedness, increased ﬁnancial fragility, and a general erosion in transparency. Emerging",,,,,,,,,,,
"economies have been left with very limited ﬁscal space, and they will be made even more",,,,,,,,,,,
vulnerable by the impending normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies.,,,,,,,,,,,
This Report highlights several priority areas for action.,,,,,,,,,,,
First is the need for early detection of signiﬁcant ﬁnancial risks. Because the balance,,,,,,,,,,,
"sheets of households, ﬁrms, ﬁnancial sector institutions, and governments are tightly ",,,,,,,,,,,
"interrelated,",risks,may,be,hidden.,The,share,of,nonperforming,loans,has,generally
remained below what was feared at the beginning of the crisis. But this could be due to,,,,,,,,,,,
forbearance,policies,that,delayed,debt,repayments,,,and,relaxed,accounting,standards.
Firm surveys in emerging economies reveal that many businesses expect to be in payment,,,,,,,,,,,
"arrears in the coming months, and so private debt could suddenly become public debt, as",,,,,,,,,,,
in many past crises.,,,,,,,,,,,
The interdependence of economic policies across countries matters as well. Public debt,,,,,,,,,,,
"has reached unprecedented levels. As monetary policy tightens in advanced economies,",,,,,,,,,,,
"interest rates will need to increase in emerging economies as well, and their currencies",,,,,,,,,,,
"will likely depreciate. Higher interest rates make debt service more expensive, reinforc-",,,,,,,,,,,
"ing the trend of recent years, and weaker currencies make debt service more burdensome ",,,,,,,,,,,
relative to the size of the economy. Liquidity problems could suddenly morph into solvency,,,,,,,,,,,
problems.,,,,,,,,,,,
The corporate–government nexus is another potential source of contingent liabilities,,,,,,,,,,,
and hidden debt. State-owned utilities have been asked to delay increases in tariﬀs and,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,xi
,,accept arrears in bill collection. Concessions and public-private partnerships have faced
,,"dramatic declines in revenue. Sooner or later, the losses could end up on the budget. Mean-"
,,"while, borrowing from foreign state-owned enterprises often escapes the surveillance "
,,of debt management agencies. These contingent liabilities and parastatal loans can raise
,,signiﬁcant ﬁnancial risks in low-income and some emerging market countries.
,,Second is the need for proactive management of distressed assets. In the absence of
,,"eﬀective resolution mechanisms for private sector debt, balance sheet problems last much"
,,"longer than they should, with loan evergreening keeping “zombie” ﬁrms alive and under-"
,,mining the strength of the recovery. Formal insolvency mechanisms need to be strength-
,,ened and alternative dispute resolution systems facilitated. Revamped legal mechanisms
,,can promote debt forgiveness and help protect the long-term reputation of former debtors.
,,Early detection of risks and proactive management may also reduce the risks asso- 
,,ciated with the servicing of sovereign debt. Reproﬁling allows moving to longer maturities
,,"and smoothing out debt-related payments. And the time for it is now, while international"
,,interest rates are still low and accessing global ﬁnancial markets is still an option. Debt
,,management can also help hedge against exchange rate volatility and currency weakness.
,,"The biggest challenge is sovereign debt restructuring. The absence of a predictable,"
,,"orderly, and rapid process for sovereign debt restructuring is costly, dampening recovery"
,,prospects and creating uncertainty. The historical track record shows that the longer the
,,"debt restructuring process takes, the larger the “haircut” creditors experience. For debtor"
,,"countries, delay presents major setbacks to growth, poverty alleviation, and development."
,,"Unfortunately, negotiations on debt restructuring for the poorest countries under the G20"
,,Common Framework are currently stalled.
,,"Finally, it is critical to work toward broad-based access to ﬁnance. Low-income house-"
,,holds are more likely to smooth out their consumption if they can save and borrow. Small
,,businesses are better able to invest and create jobs if they have access to credit. Digital
,,ﬁnance can play a critical role in enabling access to ﬁnance and fostering new economic
,,opportunities.
,,Emerging economies need to rebuild their buﬀers and avoid sacriﬁcing the accumula-
,,tion of capital—both physical and human—along the way. The path chosen for ﬁscal con-
,,solidation is critically important in this respect. The composition of government spending
,,"aﬀects economic growth, and more buoyant economic activity is critical to achieve devel-"

Preface ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the midst of exceptional uncertainty, policy makers around the globe are grappling ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the delicate task of scaling back the economic support measures put in place during,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic while encouraging creation of the conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needed to restore economic activity and growth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One signiﬁcant challenge is the lack of transparency—created or reinforced by the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pandemic,and,(unintentionally),,exacerbated,,by,policy,actions—about,,,the,risks,in,the
balance sheets of the private and public sectors. What we,,,,,,,,do,know is that the pandemic-,,,,,
induced recession of 2020 led to the largest single-year surge in global debt in decades. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Before,the,"pandemic,",private,debts,were,already,at,record,highs,in,many,advanced,,
"economies and emerging economies, leaving many households and ﬁrms poorly prepared",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to withstand an adverse income shock. Many governments were also facing record-high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"levels of debt prior to the pandemic, and many more signiﬁcantly increased their debt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"burdens to fund vital response policies. In 2020, the average total debt burden of low- and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
middle-income countries increased by roughly 9 percentage points of the gross domestic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"product, compared with an average annual increase of 1.9 percentage points over the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
previous decade. Fifty-one countries (including 44 emerging economies) experienced a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
downgrade in their sovereign debt credit rating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What we do not yet know, however, is the extent to which governments and private",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
debtors are harboring hidden risks with the potential to stymie economic recovery. In,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"particular, increased complexity and opacity in sovereign debt markets (as to who holds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the debt and under what terms) often make it difficult to assess the full extent of risks in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"government balance sheets. On the private side, common elements of pandemic response",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"programs, such as moratoria on bank loans, general forbearance policies, and a marked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"relaxation in ﬁnancial reporting requirements, have made it difficult to determine whether",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
debtors are facing short-term liquidity challenges or whether their incomes have been,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"permanently aﬀected. For both, the risk is insolvency on a scale and scope that are difficult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to gauge in advance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Within the context of uncertainty, the world is confronting the daunting challenge of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"continuing to navigate a global pandemic, while managing and reducing ﬁnancial risks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"across household, business, ﬁnancial, and government sectors. Problems in one area can",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and do reverberate across entire economies through mutually reinforcing channels that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
connect the ﬁnancial health of all sectors. What at ﬁrst blush appears to be an isolated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"disruption in one sector can very quickly spill over to the rest of the economy. For example,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if households and ﬁrms are under ﬁnancial stress, the ﬁnancial sector faces a higher risk ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of loan defaults and is less willing or able to provide credit and support economic recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,xiii,,
,,As the ﬁnancial position of the public sector deteriorates as a result of higher sovereign ,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"debt and lower tax revenue, many governments ﬁnd that they are less able to support",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,economic activity.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Policies that facilitate the early detection and swift resolution of economic and ﬁnan-,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,cial fragilities can make all the diﬀerence between an economic recovery that is robust ,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"and one that falters—or, worse, one that delays recovery altogether. Starting with an ",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,in-depth assessment of the severest and most regressive ﬁnancial and economic impacts,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"of the pandemic, this",World Development Report,,,,"puts forward a focused, actionable policy",,,,,,,
,,agenda that countries can adopt to cope with some of the harmful and potentially lasting,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,economic eﬀects of the pandemic. Some of these policies seek to reduce opacity in credit,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"markets, for example, by ensuring that banks report accurate, timely indicators of loan",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,quality or by increasing transparency around the scale and terms of sovereign debt. Other,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,initiatives aim to accelerate the resolution of debt distress through improved insolvency,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"proceedings for companies and individuals, and proactive eﬀorts to reproﬁle or restructure",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,sovereign debt.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Because there is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to economic recovery, the appropriate",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,policy mix depends critically on prevailing conditions and policy capacity. Few if any,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,governments have the resources and political leeway to tackle simultaneously all of the,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,challenges,they,face,as,the,pandemic,recedes.,Countries,will,need,to,prioritize.,The
,,"potential for policy to contribute to a lasting, inclusive recovery will depend on the ability",,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In,"2020,",as,communities,around,the,world,were,struggling,to,contain,the,spread,of,COVID-19 
"(corona virus) and manage the health and human costs of the pandemic, governments implemented a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wide range of crisis response policies to mitigate the worst social and economic impacts of the pandemic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The mobility restrictions, lockdowns, and other public health measures necessary to address the pan-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
demic rapidly produced the largest global economic crisis in more than a century. This was compounded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by a drop in demand as the pandemic aﬀected consumer behavior. Economic activity contracted in 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in about 90 percent of countries, exceeding the number of countries seeing such declines during two",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"world wars, the Great Depression of the 1930s, the emerging economy debt crises of the 1980s, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 2007–09 global ﬁnancial crisis (ﬁgure O.1). In 2020, the ﬁrst year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"global economy shrank by approximately 3 percent,1 and global poverty increased for the ﬁrst time in a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generation.2 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"To limit the impact of the crisis on households and businesses, governments enacted a swift and",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"encompassing policy response that used a combination of ﬁscal, monetary, and ﬁnancial sector poli-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cies. The case of India, which like many other countries enacted a large emergency response to the ﬁrst",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wave of the pandemic, oﬀers an example of a decisive policy response that used a wide range of policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
instruments to mitigate the worst immediate eﬀects of the crisis. When the pandemic ﬁrst erupted in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"India in March 2020, the government declared a two-month national lockdown that closed businesses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and sent workers home. The lockdown halted all manner of economic activity, and incomes fell in tan-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dem. Small businesses and low-income workers in urban areas and the informal sector were the most,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
severely aﬀected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The ﬁrst measure adopted by the Indian government was a ﬁscal stimulus package that amounted to,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and included direct support for poor households.3 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Monetary policy reduced interest rates and eased lending conditions for banks and nonbank ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
institutions. Financial sector policies were also part of the support plan; India instituted a debt repay-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ment moratorium for households and ﬁrms that ultimately lasted six months. In addition, the Indian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
government introduced a large credit guarantee scheme aimed at ensuring that small and microenter-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prises would continue to have access to credit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,India’s response to the economic crisis was similar to that of many other countries. The strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recognized that the sectors of its economy—households and businesses, ﬁnancial institutions, and gov-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ernments—are interconnected. A large shock to one sector can generate spillover risks that destabilize,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the economy at large if not addressed promptly and in an integrated manner. As the pandemic rolled on,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"producing multiple waves of infection, many countries extended relief measures beyond their original",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
timeline. Although these policies have helped limit the worst economic outcomes of the pandemic in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"short run, they also bring challenges—such as increased public and private debt burdens—that need to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be addressed soon to ensure an equitable economic recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,nonperforming loans and ﬁnancial sector distress; a lack of options for households and businesses to,,,,,

,Interconnected financial risks,,,,,
,"Although household and business incomes were most directly aﬀected by the crisis, the consequences",,,,,

,"ments (see ﬁgure O.2). Because of this interconnection, elevated ﬁnancial risks in one sector can easily",,,,,
,spill over and destabilize the wider economy if left unchecked. When households and ﬁrms are under,,,,,

,"Similarly, when the ﬁnancial position of the public sector deteriorates, for example, as a result of higher",,,,,

,One example of policies that can make a critical diﬀerence are those targeting the link between the,,,,,

"unfolded, these policies provided much-needed support to households and small businesses and helped",,,,,,
"avert a wave of insolvencies and loan defaults, which could have threatened the stability of the ﬁnancial",,,,,,
"sector. Looking ahead, ensuring that debt burdens for households and businesses are sustainable and",,,,,,
that there is continued access to credit is essential for an equitable recovery.,,,,,,
,"Similarly, governments, central banks, and regulators also used policy tools to assist ﬁnancial insti-",,,,,
tutions and prevent ﬁnancial sector risks from spilling over to other parts of the economy. In many,,,,,,
"countries, central banks lowered interest rates, injected liquidity into the market, broadened access to",,,,,,
"reﬁnancing facilities, and reduced provisioning requirements. These measures enabled banks and other",,,,,,
"institutions to continue to oﬀer ﬁnancing to households and businesses. Like many other central banks,",,,,,,
"the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, for example, injected liquidity into the banking system through ",,,,,,
"government-backed repurchase (repo) agreements, which reduced the interest rate on new credit. Cen-",,,,,,
tral banks also made unprecedented use of unconventional monetary policy tools such as asset purchase,,,,,,
programs. Twenty-seven emerging economies adopted such programs for the ﬁrst time in response to,,,,,,
the COVID-19 crisis.7 These measures were aimed at preventing a liquidity crisis and safeguarding ﬁnan-,,,,,,
"cial stability. However, debt moratoria and the provision of additional liquidity for the ﬁnancial sector",,,,,,
do not change the underlying economic conditions of borrowers. The risks now embedded in bank bal-,,,,,,
ance sheets will have to be addressed to ensure that the ﬁnancial sector is well capitalized going into the,,,,,,
recovery phase and is able to fulﬁll its role of providing credit to ﬁnance consumption and investment.,,,,,,
,The crisis response will also need to include policies that address the risks arising from high levels ,,,,,
of sovereign debt to ensure that governments preserve their ability to eﬀectively support the recov-,,,,,,
ery. The support measures adopted to mitigate the immediate impact of the pandemic on households,,,,,,
and businesses required new government spending at a time when many governments were already,,,,,,
4,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,
burdened by elevated levels of public debt. High debt levels reduce a government’s ability to support the,,,
recovery through direct support of households and ﬁrms. They also reduce a government’s ability to,,,
invest in public goods and social safety nets that can reduce the impact of economic crises on poverty,,,
and inequality. Managing and reducing high levels of sovereign debt are therefore an important con-,,,
dition for an equitable recovery.,,,
It is also important to recognize that COVID-19 is a crisis within a larger crisis arising from the,,,
 escalating impacts of climate change on lives and economies. Preserving the ability of governments ,,,
to invest in the transition to a green economy will be critical to counteract the inequitable impacts of,,,
climate change.,,,
Increased inequality within and between countries,,,
The economic impact of the pandemic has been highly unequal within and between countries. As the,,,
"COVID-19 crisis unfolded in 2020, it became clear that many households and ﬁrms were ill-prepared to",,,
"withstand an income shock of the length and scale of the pandemic. In 2020, more than 50 percent of",,,
households globally were not able to sustain basic consumption for more than three months in the event of,,,
"income losses, while the cash reserves of the average business would cover fewer than 51 days of expenses.8 ",,,
"Within countries, the crisis disproportionately aﬀected disadvantaged groups. In 2020, in 70 per-",,,
cent of countries the incidence of temporary unemployment was higher for workers who had completed,,,
only primary education.9,"Income losses were similarly larger among youth, women, the self-employed,",,
"and casual workers with lower levels of education.10 Women, in particular, were aﬀected by income and",,,
employment losses because they were more likely to be employed in sectors most aﬀected by lockdown,,,
"and social distancing measures, and they bore the brunt of the rising family care needs associated, for",,,
"example, with the closures of childcare centers and schools. According to high-frequency phone survey",,,
"data collected by the World Bank, in the initial phase of the pandemic, up to July 2020, 42 percent of",,,
"women lost their jobs, compared with 31 percent of men, further underscoring the unequal impacts of",,,
the crisis by gender.11,,,
The pattern of the crisis having a higher impact on disadvantaged groups applies to both emerging,,,
and advanced economies.12,Early evidence from a number of emerging economies points to signiﬁcant,,
increases in within-country inequality.13 It also reveals that initial disparities in job losses did not decline,,,
as lockdown and social distancing measures were relaxed. Those who suﬀered larger initial losses—,,,
"women, younger workers, urban workers, and those with low levels of formal education—recovered more",,,
slowly than their counterparts or were not able to substantially reverse the initial disparities in losses.14 ,,,
"Not surprisingly, with average incomes contracting and the eﬀects concentrated among the less well-oﬀ,",,,
the available global data suggest that the pandemic has had a substantial impact on global poverty.15 ,,,
"Similar patterns emerge for businesses. Smaller ﬁrms, informal businesses, and those with more ",,,
limited access to the formal credit market were harder-hit by income losses stemming from the pan-,,,
"demic. Larger ﬁrms entered the crisis with the ability to cover expenses for up to 65 days, compared with",,,
"59 days for medium-size ﬁrms and 53 and 50 days for small ﬁrms and microenterprises, respectively.",,,
"Moreover, micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises were overrepresented in the sectors most aﬀected",,,
"by the crisis, such as accommodation and food services, retail, and personal services. These businesses",,,
were more likely to suﬀer from supply chain disruptions that limited their access to inventory or sup-,,,
plies. Emerging data from surveys also indicate that aﬀected businesses had to contend with longer,,,
"payment terms or payment delays from buyers, including the public sector.16",,,
These indicators are particularly alarming because in many emerging economies small and infor-,,,
"mal businesses account for a large share of total economic activity and employment. It is, for example,",,,
,OVERVIEW,|,5
estimated that the informal economy accounts for about 34 percent of GDP in Latin America and Sub- ,,
Saharan Africa and 28 percent of GDP in South Asia.17,,"In India, more than 80 percent of the total labor"
force is employed in the informal sector.18 The survival of small and informal businesses therefore has a,,
direct impact on the broader economy.,,
,The pandemic also exposed and worsened preexisting fragilities in the ﬁnancial sector. Similar to,
"that of households and governments, the resilience of banks and ﬁnancial institutions at the onset of",,
the pandemic varied widely across countries. Some countries that were heavily aﬀected by the 2007–09,,
global ﬁnancial crisis had initiated meaningful ﬁnancial sector reforms in response and ensured that,,
"their banking systems were well capitalized.19 In some countries, such as Ghana, reforms also strength-",,
"ened regulation and capitalization of the microﬁnance and nonbank sector. As a result, the ﬁnancial",,
sector in these countries was better able to weather the strains of the pandemic.,,
,"Many emerging economies, however, had failed to address ﬁnancial sector fragilities in the years prior",
"to the crisis, which compounded the problems of chronically low levels of ﬁnancial intermediation and",,
"credit in the private sector. As a result, the ﬁnancial sectors of these countries were ill-prepared for a",,
"crisis of the magnitude of the COVID-19 recession, which further reduced their ability to ﬁnance con-",,
sumption and productive investment through the recovery.,,
The economic policy response to the pandemic: Swift but with,,
large variation across countries,,
"There were also marked inequalities in the crisis response across countries, which reﬂect diﬀerences",,
"in the resources and policy tools available to governments. As the pandemic intensiﬁed in 2020, the",,
size and scope of government support programs varied widely. Many low-income countries struggled to,,
"mobilize the resources necessary to ﬁght the immediate eﬀects of the pandemic, or had to take on sig-",,
niﬁcant new debt to ﬁnance the crisis response. Half of the low-income countries eligible for the Group,,
"of Twenty (G20) Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), for example, were already in debt distress or",,
close to debt distress prior to the pandemic.20,,"During the ﬁrst year of the pandemic, the debt stock of"
"these countries increased from 54 percent to 61 percent of GDP, further limiting their ability to respond",,
to the possibility of a drawn-out recovery.21 While these debt levels are low by the standards of advanced,,
"economies, which have a much higher debt carrying capacity, they have been associated with the onset",,
of debt crises in low-income countries.22,,
,Figure O.4 shows the stark variation across countries in the scale of the ﬁscal response to the,
 pandemic. The magnitude of the ﬁscal response as a share of GDP was almost uniformly large by any,,
historic metric in high-income countries and uniformly small or nonexistent in low-income countries.,,
"In middle-income countries, the ﬁscal response varied signiﬁcantly, reﬂecting marked diﬀerences in ",,
the ability and willingness of governments to mobilize ﬁscal resources and spend on support programs.,,
,"In many cases, ﬁscal emergency measures were supported by large monetary policy interventions. Sev-",
"eral emerging economy central banks, for example, used unconventional monetary policies such as asset",,
purchase programs for the ﬁrst time in history. These programs supported the ﬁscal response and pro-,,
"vided liquidity at a time it was most urgently needed. However, the capacity of central banks to support",,
"the crisis response in this manner varied dramatically, so that these policy tools were both more widely",,
used and more eﬀective in higher-middle-income countries that had deeper capital markets and a more,,
"sophisticated ﬁnancial sector. By contrast, in most low-income countries governments were constrained",,
in their response to the crisis because monetary policy was not able to play a similarly supportive role.,,
,The initial impact of the pandemic translated into rising inequality across countries in large measure,
because of the constraints many governments faced in assisting households and businesses.23 Although,,

,"Past crises have revealed that without a swift, comprehensive policy response, loan quality issues are",
"likely to persist and worsen over time, as epitomized by the typical increase in loans to “zombie ﬁrms”—",,
"that is, loans to weak businesses that have little or no prospect of returning to health and fully paying",,
oﬀtheir debts. Continued extension and rolling over of loans to such ﬁrms (also known as evergreening),,
stiﬂes economic growth by absorbing capital that would be better directed to loans for businesses with,,
high productivity and growth potential.,,
,Some ﬁnancial institutions may be unable to cope with rising NPLs and will require recapitalization,
"or resolution. If left unaddressed, rising NPLs can set the stage for systemic banking crises, which are",,
associated with severe and prolonged recessions and consequent eﬀects on poverty and inequality. A,,
prompt comprehensive response is therefore critical to preserving the ﬁnancial sector’s ability to support,,
an equitable recovery and avoid mounting losses for the ﬁnancial system. A strategy that supports,,
timely identiﬁcation and management of NPLs is necessary. The key elements of such a strategy are,,
"transparency, loan resolution, and problem bank resolution.",,
Improving transparency and supervision and reducing incentives for mismeasurement,,
An important ﬁrst step is to establish enforceable rules and incentives that support transparency about,,
the true state of banking assets. Assessing asset quality during the pandemic is complex because of the,,
great uncertainty about economic prospects and the extent and persistence of income losses. The wide-,,
spread use of debt moratoria and other support measures for borrowers has made it even more difficult,,
"for banks to assess the true repayment capacity of both existing and prospective borrowers. Indeed, debt",,
moratoria and other support measures have reduced the comparability of NPL metrics across time both,,
in countries and among countries.,,
,Accurate and timely indicators of loan quality are essential to gauge the overall health of the ﬁnancial,
sector and the ability of banks to absorb credit losses that may materialize in the near future.26 The use,,
of internationally agreed deﬁnitions of NPLs is critical for monitoring and assessing banks’ asset quality,,
in a consistent manner.27,,The easing of regulatory deﬁnitions obscures banks’ true asset quality chal-
lenges and should be avoided.,,
,Robust regulatory deﬁnitions should be underpinned by eﬀective banking supervision. Banking,
"supervisors, responsible for enforcing these regulatory deﬁnitions, must ensure that banks comply with",,
prudential rules in an increasingly challenging environment. As pressure on the asset quality of banks,,
"increases, they increasingly are susceptible to incentives to step up eﬀorts to disguise the extent of their",,
"difficulties in an attempt to avoid a supervisory or market response. Faced with these incentives, some",,
banks may exploit regulatory loopholes or engage in questionable practices such as evergreening loans,,
"or transferring loans oﬀbalance sheets to present an overly optimistic picture of asset quality, which, in",,
"turn, can make a banking supervisor’s job signiﬁcantly more difficult.",,
Resolving troubled loans through regulatory interventions,,
Governments and banking supervisors can use various interventions to encourage banks to step up,,
"eﬀorts to resolve troubled loans. To manage rising volumes of bad debt, they can require banks to adopt",,
appropriate processes and dedicate sufficient resources to recovering past-due loans. Bank business,,
"models, organizational structure, strategy, and internal resources must all reﬂect a coherent approach to",,
"managing rising NPLs, including setting up dedicated internal workout units and devising methodologies",,
to assess borrower viability.,,
,Banks hold primary responsibility for managing distressed loans. Public interventions may be nec-,
"essary as well, however, if problem loans jeopardize a banking system’s capacity to ﬁnance the real",,
10,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
economy or threaten the stability of the ﬁnancial system.,Individual bank-level strategies may not be,,
"sufficient when the increase in NPLs is systemwide, as would be expected after a pandemic. Public",,,
"policy interventions, such as national NPL resolution strategies for coordinating NPL resolution eﬀorts",,,
"across stakeholders in the economy, can play a useful role in accelerating the reduction of bad debts.",,,
"For example, the government of Serbia established a national NPL working group in May 2015 after the",,,
"banking sector NPL ratio rose to 23.5 percent after the global ﬁnancial crisis. The working group, which",,,
"included participants from the public and private sectors, developed and implemented a comprehensive",,,
"strategy for reducing NPLs,28 which contributed to a fall in the NPL ratio to a historic low of 3.7 percent",,,
in December 2020.,,,
"In response to sharp systemic increases in NPL volumes, some countries have established public asset",,,
management companies (AMCs) or a systemwide “bad bank” to manage problem loans removed from,,,
bank balance sheets. Such a step can help to restore public conﬁdence in the banking sector and prevent,,,
"unnecessary ﬁre sales. For example, in response to earlier crises, public AMCs were created in Malaysia",,,
and Spain in conjunction with publicly funded bank recapitalization schemes to overcome capital space,,,
constraints that otherwise would have hindered eﬀorts to recognize the full extent of banks’ exposure,,,
to problem loans. The case for and eﬀectiveness of public AMCs depend on a country’s circumstances,,,
and on the soundness of the overall design. This is an area in which emerging economies have in practice,,,
often experienced challenges.,,,
Dealing with problem banks,,,
When banks are unable to absorb the additional ﬁnancial stress from the pandemic and develop a viable,,,
"recovery plan, authorities must be able to deploy a robust set of early intervention measures to turn",,,
around ailing banks and resolve failing ones. Measures for dealing with failing banks should include a,,,
legal regime that sets bank failures apart from the general insolvency framework and gives authorities,,,
"more policy options and greater powers to allocate losses to shareholders and uninsured liability holders,",,,
thereby protecting depositors while shielding taxpayers against ﬁnancial sector losses.,,,
Authorities responsible for handling troubled banks should always prioritize solutions led and funded,,,
"by the private sector, building to the extent possible on the ﬁnancial buﬀers of troubled ﬁnancial entities.",,,
"The use of public money to resolve a crisis should be a last resort, deployed after private sector solutions",,,
have been fully exhausted and only to remedy an acute and demonstrable threat to ﬁnancial stability.,,,
Policy area 2: Improving the legal insolvency framework,,,
Many households and businesses are struggling with unsustainable debts as a result of the pandemic. ,,,
Insolvency proceedings can be an eﬀective mechanism to help reduce excessive levels of private debt.,,,
"However, a sudden increase in loan defaults and bankruptcies resulting from the crisis (ﬁgure O.7) ",,,
poses a signiﬁcant challenge for the capacity of insolvency frameworks to resolve bankruptcies in a,,,
"timely manner, even in advanced economies with strong institutions. This challenge stems, in part,",,,
"from the complexity of court-led insolvency processes. According to World Bank data,",resolution of a,,
corporate bankruptcy case in the average country takes more than two years.29,Complex liquidations,,
"can take even longer, even in well-functioning judicial systems.",,,
"For countries with weak insolvency frameworks, retaining the status quo creates the risk that",,,
more drastic and costlier action will be needed if NPLs and insolvency ﬁlings increase. The absence of,,,
eﬀective legal mechanisms to declare bankruptcy or resolve creditor-debtor disputes,invites political,,
interference in the credit market in the form of debt relief mandated by the government because such,,,

Strengthening formal insolvency mechanisms,,,
A strong formal insolvency law regime deﬁnes the rights and behaviors needed for orderly in-court and,,,
out-of-court workouts.37,A well-designed system includes incentives to motivate creditors and debtors,,
to cooperate in the resolution process. Other tenets of a strong system are predictable creditor senior-,,,
ity rules that deﬁne the order in which debts are repaid;38,"timely resolution, which creates a positive",,
feedback loop motivating all actors to engage in out-of-court workouts;39 and adequate expertise in the,,,

escalates to the point of insolvency.,,,
Facilitating alternative dispute resolution systems,,,
Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) frameworks can provide quicker and cheaper resolution of disputes,,,
"than the formal court system, while retaining some of the rigor that courts provide. In an ADR pro-",,,
"cess, the debtor and creditor engage directly. The process can be mediated by a third party; resolutions",,,
are contractually binding; and participants can maintain conﬁdentiality. Variations of ADR processes,,,
include degrees of court involvement. Signiﬁcant creditor buy-in and cohesion are needed in the ADR,,,
process because creditors unwilling to make concessions can bring the process to a halt. Active com-,,,
"munications by regulators with the private sector, or legal mechanisms to prevent minority creditors",,,
"from obstructing progress on a restructuring deal, are two methods that can help address the challenges",,,
associated with creditor cohesion.,,,
Establishing accessible in-court and out-of-court procedures for small businesses,,,

"Because of these factors, dedicated reforms are needed to design insolvency systems that cater to small",,,

"when possible, making fresh ﬁnancing available, and using out-of-court proceedings to keep costs down.",,,
"With these reforms, policy makers can help facilitate the survival of viable but illiquid ﬁrms and the",,,
swift exit of nonviable ﬁrms.,,,
Promoting debt forgiveness and long-term reputational protection for former debtors,,,
"Job losses, reduced operations, and declining sales stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed",,,
"many historically creditworthy individuals and entrepreneurs into delinquency. For small businesses,",,,
"which are often ﬁnanced at least in part by debt personally guaranteed by the entrepreneur, business",,,
failures can have severe adverse consequences. Because many of these borrowers have been devastated,,,

and livelihoods has made assessment even more difficult. Banks and nonbank lenders therefore react ,,
by tightening credit and reallocating lending—where possible—to observably lower-risk borrowers.,,
Lending innovations that incorporate new approaches for risk measurement and product design can,,
"counter this tendency. The accelerated digital adoption that occurred during the pandemic, coupled",,
with the ongoing digital transformation of ﬁnancial services and ﬁnancial infrastructure (in a context,,
of consumer and sector protection) could enable those innovations and help lenders better navigate,,
COVID-19–related uncertainty to continue issuing credit.,,
Mitigating risk by improving visibility and recourse,,
The pandemic has made it more difficult to assess the credit risk of potential borrowers and limited,,
lenders’ recourse when a borrower defaults.,,
New data and technologies can be used to update existing risk models and increase visibility into a ,,
"borrower’s ability to repay. For example, Konfío—a digital MSME lender that leverages electronic invoices",,
and other alternative data to supplement traditional credit information—adapted its credit algorithm,,
in the early months of the pandemic to integrate granular data on the impacts of COVID-19 on small,,
ﬁrms in Mexico. It then doubled its monthly loan disbursements during the pandemic. Other strategies,,
to enhance visibility include temporarily reducing loan tenors and leveraging digital channels to gather,,
high-frequency current transactional data. The use of digital channels can also lower delivery costs to,,
reach small businesses and households more eﬀectively.,,
Adapting loan product design and product selection can improve recourse in the event the borrower,,
does not repay. Products that allow borrowers to pledge movable assets as collateral or that oﬀer lend-,,
"ers less traditional forms of recourse, such as liens on future cash ﬂows, can help oﬀset the impacts of",,
the pandemic on traditional collateral. Working capital ﬁnancing that occurs within a supply chain,,
or is embedded in the workﬂow of a commercial transaction links credit to an existing commercial,,
"relationship, as well as to an underlying economic activity and its associated data. Forms of embedded",,
"ﬁnance are expanding into payments, lending, insurance, and other product areas in various contexts,",,
"including e-commerce, logistics, order and inventory management, and other digital platforms. These",,
and other forms of contextual lending provide both better visibility into the ﬁnancial prospects of the,,
"borrower and additional recourse—for example, through automatic repayments from the borrower’s",,
revenue through the platform.,,
Supporting new lending by insuring credit risk,,
Insuring against loss can help to restore credit growth when sufficient visibility and recourse cannot be,,
achieved using the innovations just described. Credit guarantees give lenders recourse to the guarantor,,
"in case of default by the borrower. These instruments may be oﬀered by governments, development",,
"banks, or donors to promote lending to priority segments where there are market failures in ﬁnanc-",,
ing such as small businesses. Guarantees have been a component of pandemic responses in advanced,,
"countries and several emerging economies, and partial guarantee schemes may continue to play an",,
"important role in the recovery. For example, in Burkina Faso the World Bank helped the government set",,
up a credit guarantee scheme focused on restructured and working capital loans for small and medium,,
"enterprises struggling from the COVID-19 crisis, but with potential for long-term proﬁtability. Such",,
"programs must be carefully designed to be sustainable. As economic conditions improve, guarantors",,
and their partner lenders can progressively narrow eligibility to the sectors or customer segments,,
"that continue to be most in need, and guarantee programs can be leveraged to reduce the risk asso-",,
ciated with longer-term investments to support priorities such as job creation and ﬁnancial ﬂows to ,,
low-carbon activities.,,
OVERVIEW,|,15
Adopting policies to facilitate access and manage risks,,
"Financial innovation has the potential to support responsible delivery of ﬁnancial services, but unsuper-",,
vised ﬁnancial innovation can pose risks for both consumers and ﬁnancial stability and integrity. Gov-,,
ernments and regulators must modernize their policy frameworks to balance the sometimes conﬂicting,,
imperatives of encouraging responsible innovation while also protecting customers and the ﬁnancial,,
sector’s stability and integrity. Updated regulatory and supervisory approaches should seek to recognize,,
"and enable entry into the market of new providers, introduction of new products, and innovations in the",,
use of data and analytics; enhance consumer protection policies and rules around what ﬁnance provid-,,
ers can and cannot oﬀer; and facilitate collaboration between regulators and the government authorities,,
"overseeing diﬀerent aspects of digital and embedded ﬁnance, as well as competition and market con-",,
"duct, to prevent regulatory gaps between agencies with overlapping authority. Policies should support",,
"modernization of ﬁnancial infrastructure to facilitate operational resilience and access, including both",,
"“hard” infrastructure related to telecommunications networks, payment networks, data centers, credit",,
"bureaus, and collateral registries, and “soft” infrastructure around the policies and procedures that dic-",,
"tate standards, access, and rules of engagement. These government policy responses to support digital",,
"transformation can help foster a more robust, innovative, and inclusive ﬁnancial sector.",,
Policy area 4: Managing higher levels of sovereign debt,,
"The pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in sovereign debt. As shown in ﬁgure O.9, the average total",,
debt burdens among low- and middle-income countries increased by roughly 9 percentage points of ,,
"GDP during the ﬁrst year of the pandemic, 2019–20, compared with an average increase of 1.9 percent-",,
age points over the previous decade. Although interest payments in high-income economies have been,,
"trending lower in recent years and account, on average, for a little over 1 percentage point of GDP, they",,
have been climbing steadily in low- and middle-income economies.40,,
,"Debt distress—that is, when a country is not able to fulﬁll its ﬁnancial obligations—poses signiﬁcant",
social costs. One study ﬁnds that every year that a country remains in default reduces GDP growth by,,
1.0–1.5 percentage points.41,,"During the pandemic, governments accumulated debt to ﬁnance current"
"expenditures, but it came at the cost of limiting their ability to spend in the future, including on public",,
goods such as education and public health. Underinvestment in these services can worsen inequality,,
and human development outcomes.42 High debt and lack of spending ﬂexibility also limit the capacity of,,
governments to cope with future shocks.43,,"Moreover, because governments are often the lender of last"
"resort, private sector debts can quickly become public debt if ﬁnancial and economic stability is threat-",,
ened in an economic crisis and public assistance is required. Protecting the ability of the government to,,
"invest in public goods, to act in a countercyclical manner, and to enable the central bank to deliver on its",,
unique role as the lender of last resort is a central goal of managing sovereign debt.,,
Managing sovereign debt to free up resources for the recovery,,
Countries at high risk of debt distress can pursue several policy options to make payment obligations more,,
"manageable. The feasibility of these options is shaped by the speciﬁcs of the case, including the extent of a",,
"country’s access to private capital markets, the composition of the debt and creditors, and the debtor coun-",,
try’s ability and willingness to negotiate and undertake necessary reforms. The options include modiﬁca-,,
tions of the structure of liabilities and schedule of future payments through negotiations with creditors,,
and the eﬀective use of reﬁnancing tools (debt reproﬁling). Proactive debt management can reduce the risk,,
of default and free up the ﬁscal resources needed to support an equitable economic recovery.,,
,A reproﬁling operation could be helpful when a country has multiple loans to be repaid in the same,
year. The country could issue new debt with a longer or a more even maturity proﬁle. Debt reproﬁling,,

"Three broad initiatives stand out: greater debt transparency, contractual innovation, and tax policy and",,,,,,,,,,,,
administration reforms.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eﬀective, forward-looking debt management requires comprehensive disclosure of claims against the",,,,,,,,,,,,
government and the full terms of the contracts that govern this debt. Recent debt events have high-,,,,,,,,,,,,
lighted the problem of “hidden” or undisclosed debt and the possibility of legal disputes about the lack,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tainly sets the stage for a more rapid recognition of debt sustainability problems, thereby improving",,,,,,,,,,,,

limited role in dealing with debts that require restructuring because state-contingent contracts account,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a small share of the outstanding debt contracts of emerging markets. Contracts that include enhanced,,,,,,,,,,,,
CACs account for only about half of outstanding contracts.49,,,,,,,,,,,,
A well-developed tax policy and administration are essential for debt sustainability. Higher tax rev-,,,,,,,,,,,,
enue arises principally from long-term investments in tax capacity and from structural changes in,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conclusion,,
The COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented worldwide public health crisis it unleashed led to,,
" millions of deaths, job losses, business failures, and school closings. The ensuing economic and social",,
"disruption both exposed and exacerbated existing economic fragilities, especially in emerging econo-",,
"mies, where poverty rates soared and inequality worsened.",,
,Addressing the interrelated economic risks produced by the crisis is a prerequisite for a sustained,
"and equitable recovery. This will require prompt recognition of balance sheet problems, as well as active",,
"management of the economic and ﬁnancial risks. In an ideal situation, governments would implement",,
relevant policies to address each of the risks highlighted by the crisis: ﬁnancial instability; overindebted-,,
"ness among households and businesses; reduced access to credit; and rising sovereign debt. However,",,
few if any governments have the resources and political leeway to tackle all of these challenges at once.,,
Countries will have to prioritize the most important policy actions needed. For many low-income coun-,,
"tries, tackling unsustainable sovereign debt will be the ﬁrst priority. Middle-income countries whose",,
"ﬁnancial sectors are more exposed to corporate and household debt may, in contrast, need to focus on",,
policies supporting ﬁnancial stability.,,
,Although this Report concentrates on the key domestic ﬁnancial and economic risks produced by,
"the pandemic, a country's recovery prospects will also be shaped by events in the global economy. One",,
"example is ﬂuctuations in the price of primary commodities, which are an important source of revenue",,
"for many emerging economies. Another example is exchange rate and interest rate risks, which could",,
"emerge as economic activity in advanced economies recovers and stimulus programs are withdrawn,",,
resulting in central banks tightening global liquidity and raising interest rates. These global develop-,,
"ments expose households, ﬁrms, and governments in emerging economies to ﬁnancial risks. A carefully",,
chosen policy mix must therefore take into account both domestic and global threats to an equitable,,
recovery.,,
,"At the same time, the necessity to address the risks created by the pandemic oﬀers an immense oppor-",
tunity to accelerate the shift toward a more efficient and sustainable world economy. Climate change is,,
a major source of neglected risk in the world economy.52 Failure to manage these risks will result in the,,
"continued mispricing of assets, capital misallocation, and a vicious cycle in which devastating climate",,
disasters are compounded by spikes in ﬁnancial instability.53,,The ﬁnancial sector can help activate a
"virtuous cycle by recognizing and pricing climate risks, so that capital ﬂows toward more sustainable",,
"ﬁrms and industries.54 In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have an opportunity",,
"to support the ﬁnancial sector’s ability to perform this role by, for example, mandating risk disclosures",,
"and phasing out any preferential tax, auditing, and regulatory policies for environmentally unsustain-",,
able industries.,,
,The COVID-19 pandemic is possibly the largest shock to the global economy in over a century. As,
"ﬁscal, monetary, and ﬁnancial stimulus programs are withdrawn, new policy challenges will emerge",,
at both the domestic and global levels. Early diagnosis of the economic eﬀects of the crisis and decisive,,
policy action to remedy these fault lines are needed to sustain an equitable recovery. There is no room,,
for policy complacency.,,

,Introduction,,
The COVID-19 pandemic sent shock waves through the world economy and triggered the largest global,,,
economic crisis seen in more than a century. The economic impacts of the pandemic were especially severe in,,,
"emerging economies. Global poverty increased for the ﬁrst time in a generation, and disproportionate income",,,
losses among disadvantaged populations led to a dramatic rise in inequality within and across countries.,,,
Governments responded at the onset of the pandemic with large economic programs that were successful at,,,
"mitigating the worst human costs in the short run. However, this emergency response has also exacerbated a",,,
number of preexisting economic fragilities that may pose an obstacle to an equitable recovery.,,,
,,Policy Priorities,
The economic response to the pandemic will need to address the following areas in which economic,,,
fragilities have been highlighted and worsened by the pandemic:,,,
•,Addressing increased inequality within and between countries resulting from the highly regressive,,
,impacts of the crisis.,,
•,Managing and reducing the interconnected ﬁnancial risks created by the pandemic,to prevent,
,spillover eﬀects that can threaten the return to economic growth.,,
•,Ensuring continued access to ﬁnance,to help households and businesses weather economic, uncer-
,tainty and invest in opportunities.,,
•,Preserving and restoring market transparency to enable a prompt recognition of economic risks.,,
,,,25
Introduction,,
The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic triggered a global public health crisis that overwhelmed the,,
health systems of many countries with over 200 million cases and close to 5 million deaths worldwide.,,
The outbreak of the pandemic quickly turned into the largest economic crisis seen in more than a cen-,,
"tury, as countries enacted unprecedented emergency measures, such as travel bans, mobility restric-",,
"tions, closure of nonessential businesses, limitations on public gatherings, and mandatory home-based",,
"work, that severely aﬀected economic activity. In response, household incomes, business revenue, and",,
"employment declined dramatically. Small businesses, low-income households, and vulnerable popula-",,
"tions were disproportionately aﬀected, and global poverty increased for the ﬁrst time in a generation.",,
,"The economic crisis stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic stands out in its global scale, scope,",
"and severity. In 2020, economic output contracted in 90 percent of countries, while the world economy",,
contracted by approximately 3 percent.1 The share of countries experiencing negative output growth as,,
a result of the pandemic surpassed that of both world wars and the Great Depression.,,
,The crisis is also distinct in its highly unusual indiscriminate impacts across the globe. Economic,
crises in the postwar period have typically hit advanced economies and emerging markets unevenly.,,

"aﬀected advanced economies, whereas emerging markets, whose economies were supported by robust",,
"commodity prices and rapid growth in China, were far less aﬀected. As a result, at the height of the",,
"global ﬁnancial crisis in 2009, output contracted in only 63 percent of countries, and the world economy",,
"contracted by 2.2 percent, much less than in the ﬁrst year of the pandemic.2 ",,
,The COVID-19 economic crisis is also unique in its nature and origins. Unlike most crisis episodes,
"in recent decades, the COVID-19 economic crisis did not originate as a ﬁnancial crisis or as a debt crisis",,
"in the public or private sector. Instead, it was the result of a truly exogenous event that generated both",,
"an aggregate demand and an aggregate supply shock. By contrast, the economic crises of the 1980s were",,
"sparked by government debt and ﬁnancial crises in emerging markets, and the 2007–09 crisis origi-",,
"nated from asset bubbles and ﬁnancial distress in advanced economies. In most countries, the current",,
crisis therefore does not ﬁt the prototypical pattern in which a long economic expansion is followed by,,
a recession during which borrowers who took out loans in boom times can no longer aﬀord their debt,,
"payments. Instead, when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, most countries had not been experiencing a",,
"robust economic expansion. It is not uncommon, however, for one form of crisis to morph into another.",,
"Although this economic crisis did not begin as a debt or ﬁnancial crisis, the large increases in private and",,
public debt incurred from the pandemic could very well turn it into one.3,,
,This introduction explores the short- and medium-term implications of the COVID-19 crisis for,
emerging economies. It begins by documenting the dramatic immediate impacts of the crisis on house-,,
"holds and businesses, which were most immediately aﬀected by income losses arising from the pan-",,
demic. It then highlights the unequal economic impacts of the crisis within and between countries and,,
"the large government responses to the crisis, which made use of many unprecedented policy tools and",,
was relatively successful at mitigating the worst eﬀects of the crisis in the short run but may create ,,
longer-term economic risks that pose obstacles to an equitable recovery.,,
Impacts on households,,
Household incomes and employment were severely aﬀected by the COVID-19 crisis and the public health,,
measures adopted to contain the eﬀects of the pandemic. Survey data covering 51 countries reveal that,,
"57 percent of ﬁrms reduced employment during the ﬁrst two quarters of the pandemic, directly aﬀecting",,

Greater inequality across and within countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The impact of the crisis on households has been highly regressive across and within countries. Early,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evidence suggests that 2020 per capita gross domestic product (GDP) declined more in higher-income,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
countries.11,"However, these data may not tell the full story.12",,,,,,,,,Because many households in low- and,,,,,,
"middle-income countries work in the informal sector, the impact of the pandemic on them is harder",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to assess. It is then possible that the impact of the pandemic on those countries is being underesti-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mated. Survey data indicate that the highest share of respondents who stopped working on account of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the, pandemic was recorded in middle-income countries.13,,,,,,,,One in ﬁve of the pandemic-induced poor,,,,,,,
in 2021 are estimated to reside in low-income countries (which account for 9 percent of the world pop-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ulation), and over 90 percent of those considered newly poor as a result of the crisis reside in low- or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lower-middle-income countries.14 Between 2019 and 2021, the average income of the bottom 40 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is estimated to have fallen by 2.2 percent, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the top 40 percent.15",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile, low-income countries experienced a high incidence of income losses and food insecurity,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
despite having less pronounced disruptions in employment than higher-income countries. Twenty-four,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"percent of households in low-income countries reported work stoppages, compared with 32.3 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in lower-middle-income countries and 38.7 percent in upper-middle-income countries (ﬁgure I.1). This,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ﬁnding stems, in part, from the higher share of the population engaged in agriculture in low-income",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"countries, minimizing the employment eﬀects of lockdown measures. Nonetheless, even among agricul-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tural workers who continued working, many experienced declines in income due to lockdown measures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and reduced demand for agricultural products in urban areas. In low- and middle-income countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alike, more than two in three households reported reductions in total income related to the pandemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More than a third of households in low-income countries and almost half of households in upper- ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
middle-income countries had to reduce their overall consumption. Low- and lower-middle-income,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
countries reported a higher prevalence of food insecurity and of having to resort to coping mechanisms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
such as selling assets or depleting emergency savings (ﬁgure I.4). Such eﬀects of the pandemic increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Note:,,"Data from the first wave of surveys, collected between April and July 2020, are used to ensure comparability across",,,,,,,,,,,
countries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Beyond the immediate impact of the pandemic on incomes and employment, there are also channels",,,,,,,,,,,,
through which the crisis is likely to aggravate inequality across countries in the longer term. One such,,,,,,,,,,,,,
channel is pandemic-related disruptions in access to education. Estimates based on data from 157 coun-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tries suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a loss of between 0.3 and 0.9 years of schooling,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
adjusted for quality. Pandemic-related income shocks could force close to 7 million students to drop out,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of primary and secondary education. And students from the current cohort could face a loss in lifetime,,,,,,,,,,,,,
earnings equivalent to a 5 percent annual reduction in income.19 The pandemic has also disproportion-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ately aﬀected female labor force participation, which is another channel through which the crisis aggra-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
vates preexisting inequalities.20,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Within countries, the crisis has disproportionately aﬀected disadvantaged groups. In 70 percent of",,,,,,,,,,,,
"countries, the incidence of temporary unemployment was higher21",,,,,,,for workers who completed only,,,,,,
primary education.22,,,"Income losses were similarly larger among youth, women, the self-employed, and",,,,,,,,,,
casual workers with lower levels of education.23,,,,,,These patterns are consistent with those observed in,,,,,,,
advanced economies.24 Although the impact of the pandemic on within-country inequality at the global,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"level is not yet known, it seems likely it will increase. The regressive nature of impacts suggests that the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
impact of the crisis on global poverty is a lower-bound estimate. With a widespread increase in within- ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"country inequality, the crisis would have an even bigger impact on global poverty.25 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The COVID-19 economic crisis has also been unique in exacerbating gender inequalities. Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,
of ﬁrm-level data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys reveals that women were more likely than,,,,,,,,,,,,,
men to be laid oﬀafter the onset of the pandemic.26,,,,,,According to phone survey data collected during,,,,,,,
"the ﬁrst months of the pandemic, 42 percent of women stopped working, either temporarily or perma-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nently, compared with 31 percent of men.27",,,,,,Women were disproportionately aﬀected by income and,,,,,,,
employment losses because they were more likely to be employees or owners of ﬁrms in the sectors,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most aﬀected by lockdown and social distancing measures—such as services, hospitality, and retail,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
where the demand shock was hitting hardest.28,,,,,,"Indeed, women-owned businesses were, on average,",,,,,,,
"more likely to be closed after the onset of the pandemic, especially microbusinesses and businesses in",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the hospitality industry. Female-led businesses were also less likely to have received public support.29 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, women bore the brunt of the higher care needs associated with closures of day-care ",,,
centers and schools.,,,
Evidence from recent rounds of high-frequency surveys also reveals that the initial disparities in job,,,
losses were not reduced with the relaxation of mobility restrictions and other policy measures. Those,,,
"who suﬀered larger initial losses—women, younger workers, urban workers, and persons with low levels",,,
of formal education—recovered more slowly than their counterparts and were not able to substantially,,,
reverse initial disparities in losses.30,"By September 2020, men had recovered 49 percent of their initial",,
"employment losses, compared with 30 percent of women. Workers in urban areas had recovered only a",,,
"third of their initial losses, compared with 58 percent of rural workers. Although the employment recov-",,,
"ery was slightly faster for younger workers and those without a college education, this was insufficient",,,
to signiﬁcantly reduce the gaps in job losses relative to older and college-educated workers.31,"Similarly,",,
"school closures have been associated with substantial learning losses, particularly for children from low",,,
"socioeconomic status households. Even with schools reopening, it is not clear whether these children",,,
"will be able to catch up, thereby exacerbating within-country disparities in the future.",,,
Heightened fragilities on household balance sheets,,,
The impacts of income losses sustained during the pandemic were intensiﬁed by the fact that many,,,
households were already ﬁnancially stretched at the beginning of the crisis. Although there was sig-,,,
niﬁcant within-country and cross-country variation in how well households were positioned to cope ,,,
"with income losses, one pattern that is strikingly similar across advanced and emerging economies is",,,
that very few households have the resources to weather substantial income losses for more than a few,,,
months.32,This pattern underscores the immense value of emergency cash transfers for households,,
" facing large, prolonged income losses.",,,
"Intuitively, households can accommodate income shocks either by ﬁnancing consumption with liq-",,,
"uid ﬁnancial assets, such as easily accessible savings, or by reducing expenditures to the bare minimum",,,
"required for food, essential utilities, housing expenses, and debt repayment. Both coping mechanisms do",,,
"not rely on external sources of funds such as the state or on credit markets, and they have little bearing",,,
on households’ future ability to borrow. The deﬁnition used in this Report therefore considers a house-,,,
"hold to be fully “resilient” when, in the face of an income shock, it can sustain consumption in the short",,,
to medium term using its own liquid ﬁnancial assets.,,,
Newly available data on household consumption and asset holdings that are comparable across,,,
countries make it possible to quantify the resilience of households to income losses as the ratio of a,,,
household’s total liquid wealth to its monthly consumption expenditure.33,This measure has a simple,,
"interpretation: conditional on an economic shock resulting in a complete loss of income, it is the number",,,
of months that a household can maintain its level of consumption by relying solely on its liquid ﬁnan-,,,
cial wealth. Figure I.5 shows the share of households whose resilience to a total income loss falls below,,,
"three months, six months, and one year for a sample of 24 emerging and advanced economies for which",,,
comparable data are available.34 The ﬁgure reveals that the percentage of households not able to sustain,,,
basic consumption beyond three months is higher in emerging economies (50 percent) than in advanced,,,
"economies (40 percent). However, the percentage of households that cannot self-sustain beyond one ",,,
"year is practically identical, reaching around 70 percent in both emerging and advanced economies.",,,
The same stress test approach can be used to examine how eﬀectively diﬀerent crisis response policies,,,
"counteract income losses and enhance household resilience. Figure I.6, which shows the results of this",,,
"exercise, ﬁrst considers the eﬀect of debt relief programs on household resilience. It reveals that if all",,,
household debt repayments35,"were paused by law, household resilience would improve only marginally",,

"market corrections in previous crises, such as real estate bubbles in advanced economies prior to the",,
global ﬁnancial crisis.,,
,"In emerging economies, corporate solvency risks have been further exacerbated by a sharp increase",
in dollar-denominated debt over the past decade. Low interest rates in advanced economies over this,,
period tempted ﬁrms to take on foreign rather than local currency debt.45,,Since the beginning of the
"pandemic, the currencies of many emerging markets have come under pressure. This creates problems",,
"for ﬁrms that hold signiﬁcant amounts of foreign currency–denominated debt, which is now more",,
difficult to service because the value of the borrower’s local currency revenue has fallen. The expo-,,
sure to currency risk is likely to become more acute if the recovery proceeds more quickly in advanced,,
"economies than in the rest of the world, which will lead to a further weakening of emerging market",,
currencies.,,
Impacts on the ﬁnancial sector,,
"In contrast to the immediate large impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on households and ﬁrms, the short-",,
term impacts of the crisis on the ﬁnancial sector were relatively muted because of the large-scale emer-,,
gency support and forbearance programs for borrowers aimed at preventing a spike in loan defaults.,,
Moderate initial impacts masking longer-term risks,,
Although extensive income support and debt forbearance policies have helped to insulate the ﬁnancial,,
"sector from a wave of loan defaults in the short run, few if any countries have the resources to keep",,
"these policies in place in the longer term. Therefore, ﬁnancial institutions around the world are likely to",,
come under signiﬁcant stress as debt moratoria and other support policies for borrowers are scaled back.,,
"In some economies, these risks are already becoming apparent. Loan defaults have been on the rise in",,
"India, Kenya, the Philippines, and a growing number of other middle-income countries. These emerging",,
credit risks are also reﬂected in the worsening outlooks of the main international rating agencies for,,
ﬁnancial institutions as forbearance policies are lifted.,,
,How well ﬁnancial sectors around the world are prepared to confront this challenge varies consider-,
ably. Some economies that were hard-hit by the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–09 initiated meaningful,,
"reforms and ensured that their banking systems were well capitalized. However, given that the global",,
"ﬁnancial crisis aﬀected primarily advanced economies, many emerging economies did not enact such",,
"reforms. As a result, their ﬁnancial sectors are poorly prepared to withstand a crisis of the magnitude",,
"of the COVID-19 recession. For example, in emerging economies the average levels of regulatory capital",,
holdings (the risk capital banks are required to hold to protect their balance sheets in the event of loan,,
"losses) have remained ﬂat, albeit at a relatively high level, since the global ﬁnancial crisis.46",,"Moreover,"
"bank debt-to-asset ratios, indicating greater balance sheet risk, have increased for smaller banks gener-",,
"ally, as well as for banks located in emerging economies.47 ",,
,"In many emerging economies, fragilities in the ﬁnancial sector are compounded by extensive govern-",
"ment ownership of banks, misallocation stemming from government-mandated lending programs, and",,
ﬁnancial repression policies such as the requirement that domestic ﬁnancial institutions hold govern-,,
"ment debt, which links the asset quality of the ﬁnancial sector to that of the government. In the years",,
"leading up to the COVID-19 crisis, the Financial Sector Assessment Program, a joint exercise carried",,
"out by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, highlighted problems in the resolution",,
"of nonperforming loans (especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe), loan classiﬁcation and",,
"provisioning, and bank exposure to the nonbanking sector. ",,
38,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
There has also been signiﬁcant concern about the rapid expansion of lending by nonbank ﬁnancial,,
institutions (NBFIs) and their links to the formal banking sector in many emerging markets. According,,
"to data from the Financial Stability Board, and using a narrow deﬁnition of the sector, in 2020 NBFIs",,
accounted for 14.1 percent of the total ﬁnancial assets of 29 jurisdictions.48 Nonbank lenders often face,,
"greater credit risks than banks, but are typically less regulated and can therefore accumulate signiﬁcant",,
hidden risks that can threaten ﬁnancial stability. Regulators have become increasingly aware of these,,
risks and have sought to adapt oversight of nonbank lenders.49,,
The short-term government response and its impact on ,,
public ﬁnances,,
The COVID-19 crisis triggered an extraordinarily large government response aimed at stabilizing out-,,
"put and protecting incomes in the short run. Governments enacted comprehensive ﬁscal, monetary,",,
"and ﬁnancial sector policies, many of which included policy tools that were unprecedented at this scale",,
or had not previously been used in emerging economies. Examples include direct income support mea-,,
"sures, debt moratoria, and asset purchase programs by central banks. Most economists welcomed the",,
"speed and enormous scale of this response, pointing to the unparalleled scale of the economic shock and",,
the lessons learned from past crises in which gradual approaches had proven less eﬀective at stabilizing,,
output and market expectations.50,,
Wide variation in the scale of the policy response,,
The ﬁscal policy response to the COVID-19 crisis was swift and substantial. It consisted primarily,,
of direct emergency payments to the households and ﬁrms most acutely aﬀected by a sharp drop in,,
"incomes and revenue. Many countries conducted countercyclical ﬁscal policies during the crisis, a ﬁrst",,
"for most emerging economies. The scale of the response, however, varied signiﬁcantly across countries,",,
"depending on the capacity of governments to mobilize resources, as well as institutional capabilities and",,
"the availability of social safety nets, as illustrated by ﬁgure I.10. While the extent of the ﬁscal response",,
was almost uniformly large by any historical measure in high-income countries and uniformly small or,,
"nonexistent in low-income countries, there was signiﬁcant variation in the size of the ﬁscal responses",,
"among middle-income countries. This variation reﬂects, among other factors, large diﬀerences in gov-",,
"ernment debt burdens and the ability to ﬁnance the crisis response, as well as diﬀerences in the ability of",,
central banks to support government spending through accommodative monetary policy measures. The,,
"scale and nature of the ﬁscal response were also shaped by political economy factors. For example, some",,
recent evidence indicates that less politically polarized governments and societies were able to mobilize,,
more ﬁscal resources to ﬁght the immediate eﬀects of the pandemic.51,,
"In addition to rate cuts, central banks used unconventional monetary policy tools such as asset pur-",,
chase programs to support the crisis response. Although asset purchase programs had previously been,,
"used almost exclusively in advanced economies, 27 emerging economies adopted such programs for the",,
ﬁrst time in response to the COVID-19 crisis.52 ,,
"In addition to the ﬁscal and monetary policy response to the crisis, ﬁnancial regulators around the",,
world also implemented an unprecedented set of measures to prevent ﬁnancial distress among borrowers,,
"and ﬁnancial institutions. These policies were aimed at maintaining overall ﬁnancial stability, preserv-",,
"ing critical ﬁnancial market functions, averting preventable insolvencies, and ensuring the continued",,
ﬂow of credit to households and ﬁrms. Central banks helped ﬁnancial institutions maintain liquidity,,

Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic sent shock waves through the world economy and heightened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concerns,,about,high,levels,of,private,and,public,sector,debt.,Although,the,immediate,government
"response to the crisis was largely eﬀective at stabilizing output and protecting incomes, it also aggravated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some preexisting ﬁnancial risks to household, ﬁrm, ﬁnancial sector, and public sector balance sheets that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may pose a threat to an equitable recovery in the longer term. These ﬁnancial risks do not exist in isola-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion; rather, they are connected through a series of direct and indirect links, as illustrated in ﬁgure 1.1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,This chapter outlines a conceptual framework that oﬀers an encompassing view of the interrelated,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ﬁnancial risks that will shape the economic recovery. The framework recognizes the important role of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
preexisting fragilities and global economic factors in the recovery prospects of emerging economies and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highlights the important complementarities that exist between policies aimed at addressing the ﬁnan-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cial risks that have accumulated across the economy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Addressing the economic risks that have arisen from the pandemic is important not only to ensure a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"return to economic growth, but also to counteract the dramatic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on pov-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"erty and inequality. Reducing overindebtedness among households and ﬁrms is, for example, important",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in its own right, but it also reduces the risk of a credit crunch that disproportionately aﬀects small busi-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nesses and low-income households. Similarly, managing and reducing elevated levels of government",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
debt preserve the ability of governments to assist vulnerable populations and support social safety nets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that can mitigate the eﬀects of the crisis on poverty and inequality in the longer term. The following,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

chapters apply this conceptual framework to the various areas where balance sheet risks have accumu-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lated as a result of the pandemic and highlight priority areas where decisive policy action can support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an equitable recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interconnected ﬁnancial risks across the economy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The initial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis were felt most directly by households and ﬁrms, which saw a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sharp decline in income and business revenue. These income losses are likely to have repercussions for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the wider economy through several mutually reinforcing channels that connect the ﬁnancial health of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"households, ﬁrms, ﬁnancial institutions, and governments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economic links between sectors create spillover risks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The,ﬁnancial,health,of,households,is,connected,to,the,larger,economy,through,the,so-called ,
household–ﬁnancial sector nexus and household–government nexus. When the ﬁnancial health of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"households deteriorates, it can directly aﬀect the ﬁnancial sector through a rise in loan defaults and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"an increase in loan provisioning requirements, which reduce the ability of banks to issue new loans to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"creditworthy borrowers. Similarly, when balance sheet conditions in the ﬁnancial sector worsen, banks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"supply households with less credit and charge higher interest rates, which depresses economic activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ﬁnancial health of households is similarly connected with that of governments because gov-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ernments can provide households with direct support in the form of transfer payments, social safety",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nets, insurance, and employment. These support measures can help households weather the eﬀects ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of an economic downturn, or an aggregate shock such as the COVID-19 crisis, that overwhelms con-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ventional insurance mechanisms. Governments, in turn, rely on households as a source of tax reve-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nue, which declines when incomes are low, unemployment is high, and household balance sheets are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under stress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly, the",,corporate sector is connected to the wider economy through links with the ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,,
sector—the so-called corporate–ﬁnancial sector nexus—and through links with the public sector—the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
corporate–government nexus. The ﬁnancial condition of the corporate sector aﬀects banks and non-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bank ﬁnancial institutions directly through insolvency and loan defaults. The health of the ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sector, in turn, aﬀects ﬁrms through the availability of credit: when there is stress on ﬁnancial sector",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"balance sheets, banks extend less credit and charge more for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are multiple feedback loops that can reinforce these links. First, banks are often tempted to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delay recognition of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and keep channeling credit to ﬁrms that are de facto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"insolvent. Such “zombie lending” misallocates credit to unproductive ﬁrms, reduces the access of proﬁt-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"able ﬁrms to ﬁnancing, and has historically been an important factor in prolonged periods of low eco-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nomic growth. Second, in times of economic crisis lenders may not be able to distinguish between ﬁrms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that face temporary liquidity problems and those that are truly insolvent. They may, then, ration credit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to both, thereby further depressing economic activity.1 In emerging economies, government ownership",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of banks and the greater opacity of market information make these feedback loops more pronounced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ﬁnancial health of the corporate sector is also connected to that of the government. Govern-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ment spending supports economic activity in the corporate sector directly through public procure-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ment and indirectly through transfers, guarantees, infrastructure investments, and other support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"schemes, often aimed at priority sectors such as agriculture or small enterprises. Similarly, tax policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can stimulate economic activity and set incentives for the efficient allocation of resources. Through,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this channel, tax policy has a direct impact on productivity in the corporate sector. The ﬁnancial",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,EMERGING RISKS TO THE RECOVERY,,,,|,51
"health of the corporate sector, in turn, aﬀects governments directly through the taxation of ﬁrms and",,
"indirectly through the taxation of labor income and economic growth, which expands the tax base of",,
the economy as a whole.,,
,The connection between the government and ﬁnancial sectors has received the most attention in,
recent economic crises2,,and is especially important in emerging economies where government debt 
and banking crises have often coincided.3,,The domestic ﬁnancial sector is connected to the ﬁnancial
"health of the government through two direct and two indirect channels, collectively known as the ",,
"government–ﬁnancial sector nexus. As for the direct channels, ﬁrst, banks are directly exposed to the",,
government’s default risk if they hold government securities.4,,"Through this channel, a deterioration in"
"the government’s ﬁnancial position directly aﬀects ﬁnancial institutions’ balance sheets, increasing bor-",,
"rowing costs and reducing banks’ ability to supply credit. Conversely, banks are an important source of",,
funding for the government through the purchase of government bonds. When ﬁnancial sector balance,,
"sheets are weak, funding costs go up, making it difficult for governments to reﬁnance existing short-",,
term debt (known as rollover risk) and to ﬁnance new expenditures.5,,The absence of well-functioning
"bank resolution and crisis management frameworks can amplify negative feedback loops, particularly if",,
the government’s ability to support the ﬁnancial system becomes compromised.,,
,"Second, governments and central banks have in place explicit arrangements, such as emergency",
"liquidity assistance, to support ailing albeit solvent banks in well-circumscribed conditions. These com-",,
"mitments are more extensive in countries with substantial state ownership of banks. There, the gov-",,
ernment is directly exposed to losses in the ﬁnancial sector through reduced dividends and losses in,,
its equity holdings and is expected to provide liquidity and other types of support in times of crisis.,,
"However, even in countries with little or no state involvement in the ﬁnancial sector, governments typ-",,
ically are not able to abstain from bailing out systemically important ﬁnancial institutions in a crisis.,,
Such bailouts for “too big to fail” institutions can have a signiﬁcant direct impact on the government’s,,
ﬁnancial position. The mere expectation of such bailouts can worsen fragilities in the ﬁnancial sector by,,
encouraging excessive risk-taking among banks.6,,
,Risks to ﬁnancial sector and government balance sheets are also connected through two indirect,
"channels and feedback loops. First, the two sectors are connected through interactions between the",,
ﬁscal and real (nonﬁnancial) sectors of the economy. A deterioration in the government’s ﬁnancial,,
position will ultimately require ﬁscal consolidation (mobilizing tax revenue and reducing expendi-,,
"tures), which dampens economic activity. This, in turn, may increase insolvencies and put pressure on",,
"the ﬁnancial sector. Second, the ﬁnancial sector and government are connected through interactions",,
between the banking and real sectors of the economy. The production of goods and services depends,,
"on access to credit, which is reduced when the ﬁnancial sector is distressed. This reduction slows eco-",,
"nomic activity, triggers automatic stabilizers such as countercyclical welfare expenditures, and lessens",,
"the government’s ability to raise tax revenue. In addition, many governments support speciﬁc sectors",,
"of the economy, such as agriculture and small businesses, through ﬁnancial sector programs such as",,
"partial credit guarantees, directed lending, or public-private partnerships. When business conditions",,
"worsen, governments can be exposed to credit losses in these loans.",,
,"In emerging economies, the interconnected risks of households, ﬁrms, the ﬁnancial sector, and gov-",
ernment are exacerbated by external factors stemming from developments in the global economy. For,,
"example, in many small, open economies, households, ﬁrms, and government borrow in foreign cur-",,
"rency. When the value of the local currency depreciates, foreign currency debt becomes more expensive",,
and often unsustainable relative to the local currency income of the borrower. Low- and middle-income,,
"countries, and low-income countries in particular, are also more dependent on commodity exports ",,
"(32 percent of high-income countries are commodity-dependent, compared with 91 percent of low-income",,
52,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
"countries).7 Global economic crises, such as the COVID-19 shock, often coincide with a decline in com-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"modity prices. This disproportionately aﬀects government revenue in low-income countries, further",,,,,,,,,,,,,
reducing their ability to counteract the crisis through expansionary ﬁscal policy (higher government,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spending or tax reductions).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Effective policies can counteract risks to the recovery,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the economic risks faced by households, ﬁrms, the ﬁnancial sector, and government are inter-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"connected, the relationship between these risks is not predetermined (ﬁgure 1.2). Well-designed ﬁs-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cal, monetary, and ﬁnancial sector policies can turn the links between sectors of the economy from a",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, for example, many governments",,,,,,,,,,,,,
immediately used ﬁscal resources to support the balance sheets of households and businesses in order,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to prevent a wave of loan defaults and a spillover of the economic shock to the ﬁnancial sector. Similarly,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
countries made extensive use of monetary and ﬁnancial sector policies to strengthen the resilience of,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ﬁnancial sector and ensure that well-capitalized banks were in a position to continue supplying the,,,,,,,,,,,,,
economy with credit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However,",the,extent,to,which,governments,can,mitigate,the,longer-term,risks,arising,from,the
COVID-19 crisis diﬀers dramatically across countries because of wide variation in preexisting economic,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fragilities and access to resources. This disparity makes an unequal recovery within and across countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a very likely outcome. For example, preventing a spillover of household and corporate balance sheet risks",,,,,,,,,,,,,
to the ﬁnancial sector requires direct ﬁscal support to households and ﬁrms whose incomes have been,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aﬀected by the pandemic. But given high preexisting levels of government debt and declining tax revenue,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"during the crisis, few emerging economies had the capacity to ﬁnance such anticyclical policies. The",,,,,,,,,,,,,
result was one of two pitfalls: countries either were not able to enact support policies comprehensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"enough to prevent a surge in insolvencies, loan defaults, and spillovers from households and ﬁrms to the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ﬁnancial sector, or the scale of support programs required signiﬁcant new government borrowing, which",,,,,,,,,,,,,
will constrain the ability of governments to provide ongoing support in the event of a drawn-out recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"In addition to diﬀerent degrees of policy space, there is also wide variation in structural factors,",
"such as the extent of informality in the economy, the quality of the legal system, the independence of",,
"the central bank, and the access to ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial technologies that can help or hinder the",,
reduction of economic risks that may threaten the recovery.,,
,The COVID-19 pandemic is also the ﬁrst crisis in which access to digital technology and infrastruc-,
ture plays an important role in determining both the severity of the crisis impacts and the speed of ,,
"the crisis recovery. In economies with a strong digital infrastructure, a larger share of the workforce ",,
"was able to work remotely, thereby reducing economic disruptions and job losses arising from the pan-",,
"demic. Moreover, digital payment channels were used where they were available to disburse support pay-",,
"ments to households and ﬁrms, allowing beneﬁciaries to receive relief payments more quickly. A strong",,
"digital infrastructure will also be an important factor in the crisis recovery because digital payments,",,
"e-commerce, and digital communications reduce the need for in-person interactions and enable normal",,
economic activity to resume faster. New ﬁnancial technologies can also reduce information asymme-,,
"tries, support sound risk management, and allow lenders to support the recovery through the uninter-",,
rupted provision of credit to households and businesses.,,
,"Where governments are able to enact eﬀective crisis response policies, these policies can act as a",
circuit breaker that lessens balance sheet risks and gives rise to a virtuous cycle with positive spillovers,,
"between the sectors. Where governments are unable to enact eﬀective policies, or where such policies are",,
"hampered by structural factors beyond their control, a vicious cycle can emerge in which risks in each",,
sector accumulate and reinforce each other over time.,,
From health crisis to ﬁnancial distress: Emerging risks to ,,
the recovery,,
The COVID-19 crisis and many of the policies enacted to counter it have reinforced the economic links,,
"between households and ﬁrms, the ﬁnancial sector, and government. Although the immediate govern-",,
ment response to the crisis was swift and largely eﬀective at mitigating the worst human costs of the pan-,,
"demic, it also exacerbated preexisting ﬁnancial fragilities by, for example, triggering a dramatic increase",,
"in private and public sector debt. These fragilities, if not addressed decisively, could pose a threat to a",,
strong and equitable recovery in the longer term. One challenge policy makers face is that many of the,,
policies undertaken during the COVID-19 crisis are altogether novel (such as central bank asset purchase,,
"programs in emerging economies), have not previously been used at this scale (such as debt moratoria",,
"and regulatory forbearance), or have the potential to create various longer-term risks to the recovery,",,
"such as hidden debts and contingent liabilities, which may become apparent only much later. As the",,
"immediate eﬀects of the pandemic subside, policy makers face the difficult task of scaling back these",,
policies without dampening the recovery or worsening the already highly regressive impacts of the crisis.,,
Households and firms,,
"Despite the extensive ﬁscal support measures taken by governments worldwide, the pandemic has led",,
to a signiﬁcant tightening of household balance sheets. Although many countries enacted cash transfer,,
"and income support measures to support households and prevent spillovers to the ﬁnancial sector, many",,
of these programs were not sufficient to compensate for the full extent of income losses. As highlighted,,
"in the introduction to this Report (ﬁgure I.5), the majority of households in both emerging and advanced",,
economies do not have enough liquid assets to sustain basic consumption for more than three months,,

"informal insurance mechanisms that could have mitigated the impact of the economic shock, such as",,
"borrowing from family and friends, were largely ineﬀective. In the majority of emerging economies,",,
government transfer payments could not compensate for the sharp decline in incomes and were an,,
"insufficient substitute for these informal insurance mechanisms. Moreover, access to available support",,
schemes often varied dramatically across population groups and did not reach households employed in,,
"the informal sector or households without access to a formal ﬁnancial account, who were among those",,
most severely aﬀected by the crisis. This uneven access to support programs is likely to increase poverty,,
and inequality and weaken the resilience of households in the longer run (see spotlight 1.1).,,
,"To ward oﬀan immediate spike in defaults on consumer debt and spillovers to the ﬁnancial sector,",
many governments supplemented income support measures with far-reaching debt forbearance poli-,,
"cies. Many of these debt relief measures also included a freeze on credit reporting—that is, borrowers",,
who were late on their loan payments were not reported to credit bureaus and did not suﬀer a deteriora-,,
"tion of their credit score. Such policies create a difficult trade-oﬀ. On the one hand, they can be useful in",,
the face of a transitory shock because they reduce the likelihood that borrowers are forced to default on,,
"their loans or lose access to credit as a result of temporary liquidity problems. However, such forbearance",,
"policies may not be sufficient to prevent spillovers to the ﬁnancial sector if they are lifted prematurely,",,
forcing defaults among otherwise creditworthy borrowers whose income has not yet recovered. On the,,
"other hand, if debt relief policies are left in place too long, they can hide the true extent of nonperform-",,
ing loans and mask credit risks that materialize once debt moratoria are lifted. Box 1.1 describes how,,
debt moratoria were used as part of the short-term response to the pandemic in India and were success-,,
ful in warding oﬀa large spike in loan defaults in the early stages of the crisis.,,
,"Similarly, a broad range of policies have been enacted to provide liquidity to the corporate sector in",
"the hope that, because the public health crisis will be temporary, so, too, will be the ﬁnancial distress",,
"of ﬁrms. These policies have included direct grants and transfer payments, tax breaks, as well as credit",,
subsidies and guarantees. Although the extension of direct support to businesses is sensible in the short,,
"run to prevent insolvencies of viable ﬁrms and associated job losses, it is important that support policies",,
be designed in a way that does not distort the allocation of resources in the longer term. The pandemic,,
"has triggered structural changes in the world economy, which will ultimately necessitate a reallocation",,
of resources between sectors. Some areas such as tourism and corporate real estate are expected to take,,
"a long time to recover to their precrisis levels, while areas such as e-commerce, services, and information",,
technology are expected to expand their relative shares of the economy. Temporary support programs,,
"that are left in place for too long, or that target speciﬁc industries through preferential tax treatment,",,
"transfers, or credit subsidies, run the risk of channeling scarce resources to sectors and ﬁrms that the",,
crisis has rendered unviable. Evidence from past crises shows that this type of misallocation tends to,,
"beneﬁt large ﬁrms in stagnating sectors to the detriment of smaller and more efficient ﬁrms, as well as",,
sectors with higher growth potential. Emerging evidence on the impacts of COVID-19 support programs,,
"suggests that this pattern also holds in the current crisis, with support programs disproportionately",,
beneﬁting less productive ﬁrms in politically favored sectors.8 This discrepancy could slow the economic,,
recovery and delay the reallocation of resources to more sustainable sectors.,,
,The ﬁnancial position of households and ﬁrms will also be aﬀected by feedback eﬀects from the gov-,
ernment and the ﬁnancial sector. Governments that entered the crisis with elevated debt and limited,,
ﬁscal resources were either unable to mobilize sufficient resources for the crisis response or will have,,
to phase out support programs prematurely. Data from the World Bank’s COVID-19 Crisis Response,,
Survey reveal that the ﬁscal response to the pandemic was signiﬁcantly constrained by limited access,,
to domestic borrowing in 72 percent of low-income countries and 57 percent of lower-middle-income,,
"countries, by limited access to foreign borrowing in 83 percent of low-income countries and 61 percent ",,

,Some debt moratoria enacted in response to the COVID-19 crisis were accompanied by a freeze,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on credit reporting—that is, regulators instructed banks to not report delinquent borrowers to credit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bureaus for the duration of the moratorium. Although such a measure protects borrowers from being,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"excluded from the credit market because of a temporary liquidity shock, it complicates the task of assess-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing the true credit risk on bank balance sheets. So long as forbearance programs are in place, banks are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"largely unable to distinguish illiquid from insolvent borrowers, which may make them more reluctant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to issue new credit. This pattern may already be evident in some economies. Since the fourth quarter of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2019, the percentage of loans to total assets has fallen, and lending standards have tightened in countries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that were more severely aﬀected by emergency measures (see chapter 2 for a discussion).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Finally, debt forbearance programs always carry the risk of creating incentives for evergreening and",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"zombie lending—that is, they tempt lenders to extend credit to insolvent borrowers to avoid having to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
classify these loans as nonperforming. Through the ﬁnancial sector–corporate nexus and the ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sector–household nexus, evergreening and zombie lending have negative eﬀects on the real economy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because they depress lending to creditworthy households and viable ﬁrms. As a result, households and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"crunch (see box 1.2). Although international regulatory standards, such as the Basel III framework,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"allow for some ﬂexibility to enact such regulatory forbearance measures, some regulators relaxed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prudential regulation beyond international standards in response to the crisis. This is an extremely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problematic policy choice because the relaxation of prudential oversight encourages ﬁnancial insti-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tutions to originate poorly screened loans. This contributes to the accumulation of loans whose true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tion, numerous political economy factors will make it extremely difficult to reverse the relaxation of ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"regulatory standards once the crisis subsides, especially in countries with weaker institutions and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"limited central bank independence. In the longer run, the use of regulatory forbearance policies that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go beyond the ﬂexibility embedded in international frameworks will magnify ﬁnancial sector risks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and increase the vulnerability of countries to ﬁnancial crises. This is illustrated by previous crisis epi-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sodes in which such policies were used on a much more limited scale than in the COVID-19 crisis and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In,,many,emerging,"markets,",nonbank,ﬁnancial,institutions,account,for,a,high,share,of,pri-
vate credit. They are typically less regulated than banks and may therefore accumulate credit risks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that are less apparent than the risks to bank balance sheets. Nonbank lenders—including microﬁ-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nance institutions and ﬁntech lenders—also account for a large share of lending to consumers and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ﬁscal deﬁcits and signiﬁcant increases in the stock of domestic debt have also been associated with,,
"higher inﬂation, which acts as a highly regressive tax on low incomes and exacerbates the impacts of a",,
crisis on poverty and inequality.,,
,"Elevated government risks can also spill over to the ﬁnancial sector, particularly in low- and middle- ",
income economies. Recent studies have evaluated the potential fallout from rising government debt,,
levels. One study ﬁnds that about half of identiﬁed episodes of rapid debt accumulation across country,,
"groups are associated with ﬁnancial crises, which tend to be severer than those occurring without the",,
presence of a debt buildup in the public sector.13 Another study ﬁnds no association between debt build-,,
"ups and a higher likelihood that high-come economies undergo a ﬁnancial crisis, but it conﬁrms that",,
debt buildups are associated with worse outcomes in the ﬁnancial crises that do occur.14,,Increases in
government debt are thus potentially associated with a heightened risk of ﬁnancial crises in emerging,,
"economies, and, once they occur, large debt loads pose a signiﬁcant obstacle to crisis resolution.",,
,"Against this backdrop, it is important to note that the ﬁscal response to the COVID-19 crisis has",
"been signiﬁcantly ﬁnanced with domestic debt held by local investors such as banks, pension funds, ",,
"and other ﬁnancial institutions, thereby tightening the link between government and ﬁnancial sector",,
balance sheets. Government risk downgrades thus lead to a direct deterioration of asset quality on the,,
balance sheets of ﬁnancial institutions and reduce the ﬁnancial sector’s ability to support the recovery.,,
"During 2020, one-third of the governments assessed by the three main rating agencies suﬀered a down-",,
"grade in their risk rating.15 This deterioration can, in turn, require governmental intervention to recap-",,
italize ﬁnancial institutions and potentially trigger shocks to government budgets through contingent,,
liabilities and further increases in the debt stock.,,
,Recent research on the ﬁscal costs of contingent liabilities can help to quantify these risks. One study,
ﬁnds that when contingent liabilities materialize (such as when a government needs to rescue a state-,,
"owned enterprise or subnational entity), the average ﬁscal cost is 6 percent of GDP. The ﬁscal costs are",,
"even higher for contingent liabilities in the ﬁnancial sector, where bailouts can cost as much as 40 percent",,
of GDP.16,,"State-owned enterprises, which account for a large share of the corporate revenue base and"
"essential services in many countries, are a source of signiﬁcant contingent liability risks for governments.",,
"For example, in 2018 Angola faced downward pressure on its government credit ratings after an unex-",,
"pected one-oﬀsupport payment of $8 billion (7 percent of GDP) to Sonangol, the national oil company,",,
became necessary.17,,"Similarly, Indonesia’s largest utility company required a bailout at a cost of 4 per-"
"cent of GDP to the taxpayer in 1998. In the same way, ﬁnancial pressures on state-owned enterprises",,
"increased considerably during the pandemic. Many of the largest state-owned enterprises, especially in",,
"low-income countries, export natural resources, which are vulnerable to the commodity price shocks and",,
exchange rate ﬂuctuations that will occur during the crisis recovery period.,,
,"Meanwhile, some COVID-19 crisis response programs have given rise to new contingent liabilities",
altogether. Many governments extensively used credit guarantee schemes to continue the ﬂow of credit,,
to households and ﬁrms during the crisis. Such programs are attractive in the short run because they,,
"have no immediate ﬁscal cost to the government, but they can create signiﬁcant longer-term risks to",,
government ﬁnances if loans covered by the program default. The magnitude of contingent liabilities,,
"stemming from credit guarantee schemes is typically difficult to estimate, but it can be substantial, as",,
evidence from past crises illustrates.18,,
The global economy,,

the massive monetary policy response to the pandemic. As the economic recovery proceeds and stim-,,
"ulus measures are gradually withdrawn in advanced economies, interest rates will rise. This increase",,
"could threaten the solvency of ﬁrms, ﬁnancial institutions, and governments in emerging economies",,
that have beneﬁted from short-term ﬁnancing at low interest rates and will face higher reﬁnancing costs,,
going forward. Rising interest rates in high-income economies will also put pressure on the currencies,,
"of emerging economies, which increases the ﬁnancial burdens faced by ﬁrms, ﬁnancial institutions, and",,
governments that have debt denominated in a foreign currency.,,
"In addition to a less benign interest rate environment, the recovery in emerging economies will also",,
"be aﬀected by the lower growth of the world economy. In the aftermath of the global ﬁnancial crisis,",,
"low-income economies were only moderately aﬀected, largely due to robust growth in important emerg-",,
"ing markets, particularly China, which accounts for a sizable share of bilateral lending and direct invest-",,
"ment in low-income economies. By contrast, the economic eﬀects of the COVID-19 crisis have been felt",,
"globally, and lower economic growth in China and other emerging markets could aﬀect low-income",,
"countries through several channels, including commodity prices and a reduction in bilateral lending and",,
direct investment.,,
Conclusion ,,
"Although the immediate crisis response, which included extensive eﬀorts to provide households and",,
"ﬁrms with liquidity, was essential to mitigate the hardships caused by income losses from the pandemic,",,
few governments have the resources to sustain these programs until economic activity has fully recov-,,
"ered. This gives rise to the possibility that risk spillovers among the household, ﬁrm, ﬁnancial, and gov-",,
ernment sectors of the economy will aggravate preexisting economic fragilities and pose a threat to an,,
"equitable recovery. Interconnected risks to the recovery are a concern, especially in emerging economies",,
where such fragilities were already more pronounced at the onset of the pandemic.,,
"Well-designed ﬁscal, monetary, and ﬁnancial sector policies can help reduce these risks and prevent",,
them from aﬀecting the wider economy. The following chapters explore the primary risks that aﬀect,,
each of the main sectors of the economy and propose policies that can counteract these risks with the,,
goal of supporting an equitable recovery.,,
Beginning with the concern that many households and ﬁrms will continue to face income losses,,
"resulting in loan defaults once debt moratoria are lifted, chapter 2 turns to the risk to the ﬁnancial sector",,
posed by uncertainty about the true extent of credit risk and the quality of assets on the balance sheets of,,
ﬁnancial institutions. The chapter examines the steps regulators can take to proactively increase trans-,,
"parency about credit risk and deal with distressed assets and, if necessary, troubled banks. Chapter 3",,
takes a closer look at how the establishment and reform of insolvency frameworks can help the recovery,,
by allowing private sector borrowers to reduce their debts to sustainable levels. Chapter 4 then explores,,
how ﬁnancial institutions can continue to provide credit to households and ﬁrms through the recovery.,,
It focuses on approaches to managing and mitigating risks in the face of heightened economic uncer-,,
"tainty, which limits the ability of lenders to form an accurate assessment of credit risk and reduces the",,
recourse they have in the event of default. Chapter 5 discusses the risks posed by the dramatic increase,,
in levels of government debt and describes policies that can improve debt management and avoid debt,,
distress. Chapter 6 concludes the Report by outlining policy priorities for the recovery.,,

Introduction,,,
The pandemic and the associated policy responses have signiﬁcantly aﬀected the ﬁnancial position of,,,
"households, ﬁrms, and governments. The payment and enforcement moratoria described in chapter 1",,,
have supported borrowers by allowing a temporary halt in their bank repayment obligations. In applying,,,
"these moratoria, banks have been able to help mitigate the economic fallout from COVID-19 (coronavirus).",,,
,It is not yet clear which borrowers will be permanently aﬀected by the pandemic and how debtors will,,
"adjust to the structural changes in the economy. It is evident, however, that many borrowers are facing",,,
ﬁnancial difficulties that go beyond liquidity stress. This situation is an unprecedented challenge for,,,
"banks and bank supervisors because the magnitude of the ongoing shock, the uncertainty of the impact,",,,
"as well as the ensuing government support have made the screening, monitoring, and management of",,,
risk extremely difficult.,,,
,Rising borrower distress is widely expected to translate into increases in nonperforming loans (NPLs),,
"in the banking sector, although this is not yet clearly evident in reported NPL ratios. Data suggest that",,,
as of August 2021 the ratio of reported NPLs to total loans in most countries was broadly stable (ﬁgure,,,
"2.1).1 However, for several reasons the data may not reﬂect the full reality of NPL levels:",,,
,• ,Moratoria and other borrower support measures were still in place in many countries in the ,
,,"second quarter of 2021,2",as were ﬁscal and monetary interventions aimed at cushioning the
,,impact of the pandemic on households and ﬁrms (chapter 1).,
,• ,Relatively tranquil global ﬁnancial markets have also inﬂuenced countries’ domestic ﬁnancing,
,,"conditions, especially by easing pressure on government debt reﬁnancing.",
,• ,NPL data are often made available with a signiﬁcant time lag.,
,• ,Many countries continue to apply regulatory deﬁnitions of NPLs that are predominantly based,
,,on payment arrears (and are therefore backward-looking).,
,"Notwithstanding the seemingly positive data, bankers and policy makers anticipate that NPLs will",,
increase signiﬁcantly when governments lift moratoria and borrowers become obligated to repay their,,,
loans according to their original repayment schedules. Some countries are already reporting signiﬁcant,,,
"increases in special-mention loans (loans with potential weaknesses in repayment prospects, but not",,,
yet considered nonperforming) and an acceleration of preemptive loan restructuring that may delay,,,
the recognition of credit losses. These developments suggest that rising pressures on asset quality are,,,
forthcoming.,,,
,"Banks have processes to manage NPLs in the normal course of business, but the scale and complex-",,
"ity of the expected increase in NPLs could overwhelm the capacity of the banking system, creating",,,
"pressures that aﬀect the broader economy. For example, when dealing with large and rising volumes",,,
"of NPLs, banks often stop ﬁnancing both the supply side of the economy by denying lending to viable",,,
ﬁrms for investment and working capital and the demand side by declining to ﬁnance consumption and,,,
"household credit. For banks highly exposed to slow-growing, low-productivity ﬁrms, capital can become ",,,
"tied up in low-performing sectors at the expense of high-growth ones. Looking ahead, then, a rise in",,,
"NPLs could aﬀect the banking sector’s capacity to support the economic recovery with fresh lending,",,,
while increasing the risk of bank failures. The concern is greater for emerging economies that are heavily,,,
exposed to credit risk and that tend to rely on bank credit to ﬁnance the real economy.3,,,

tive capital. Three components of an eﬀective strategy are covered in this chapter:,,,,,,,,,,
,• ,"Identifying NPLs—clear-cut, consistent practices for banks to use in reporting on asset health,",,,,,,,,
,reinforced by eﬀective supervision and strong incentives to encourage speed and transparency.,,,,,,,,,
,• ,Developing operational capacity for addressing NPLs—techniques to segment NPLs according to,,,,,,,,
,viability and complexity and to deploy the right management method.,,,,,,,,,
,• ,Handling problem banks—decisive policies for dealing with banks at risk of failure.,,,,,,,,
,"Banks are primarily responsible for resolving NPLs, and yet supervisory authorities should have a",,,,,,,,,
"clear diagnostic of the factors driving the deterioration of a bank’s asset quality. Speciﬁcally, they should",,,,,,,,,,
"have accurate data gauging the NPL exposure of individual banks, as well as a breakdown between",,,,,,,,,,
"households and ﬁrms and between credit for investment and consumption, together with details on the",,,,,,,,,,
sectoral composition of credit.6,,,,Resolving NPLs also requires a legal system that balances the interests,,,,,,
"of creditors and borrowers and supports debt restructuring and reorganization of viable ﬁrms, as well as",,,,,,,,,,
an orderly exit of unviable ones (the legal system is addressed in chapter 3).,,,,,,,,,,
,The themes discussed are commonly accepted building blocks of an eﬀective NPL resolution strat-,,,,,,,,,
"egy, but country-level priorities may vary, depending on the sophistication and strength of countries’",,,,,,,,,,
"banking sectors, the severity of the economic impact of the pandemic, the capacity of ﬁrms to adjust,",,,,,,,,,,
"and developments in the legal, regulatory, and institutional environments. Administrative capacity is",,,,,,,,,,
another important factor because countries vary in their ability to undertake complex and comprehen-,,,,,,,,,,
"sive legal, regulatory, supervisory, and taxation policies in a coordinated manner and in conjunction",,,,,,,,,,
with public and private sector stakeholders.,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,RESOLVING BANK ASSET DISTRESS,|,81,
,Policy makers and bank leaders should act with urgency on the advice laid out in this chapter as,,
best ﬁts their capacity—ideally,,before,support measures are lifted and distressed asset levels rise—
because developing the systems and capacity needed to deal with NPLs takes time.7,,Those who prefer ,
to wait and see risk missing the opportunity to get ahead of the problem. Such a delay not only prevents,,,
"recovery of viable capital, but also can lead to long-term low investment across an economy.",,,
Why do NPLs matter?,,,
"High NPL levels burden all levels of an economy. For borrowers, failure to repay a debt may lead to the",,,
"loss of assets and business opportunities and jeopardize future access to credit, which has negative spill-",,,
"over eﬀects on the broader economy. For banks, asset quality problems can lead to capital misallocation,",,,
"higher funding costs, and lower proﬁtability.8 These issues can drive up the cost of ﬁnance for borrowers",,,
"and impair a bank’s ability to run a viable, sustainable business. Banks may respond by reducing lending",,,
"volumes, which often leads to the exclusion of underserved, higher-risk groups such as MSMEs, women,",,,
and the poor.9,,,
,"At the aggregate level, high NPLs depress economic growth. Because capital is tied up in under-",,
"performing sectors, growing sectors may have limited access to new capital, and so market conﬁdence",,,
suﬀers.10,,Banks with high exposure to NPLs and narrow capital buﬀers may be inclined to reduce the,
provision of credit11,,and continue to ﬁnance weak or insolvent borrowers—so-called zombie lending.12 ,
"When banks’ capital is locked up in troubled sectors and companies, some second-round business fail-",,,
"ures may be prevented, but it also diverts funds from more productive sectors of the economy. Inefficient",,,
"ﬁrms could thus have a dominant impact on the functioning of input and output markets, translating",,,
"into lower economic output, investment, and employment.13",,,
,The challenge is particularly acute following ﬁnancial crises when bank exposure to problem assets,,
often persists at elevated levels because of a lack of incentives and frameworks to resolve them. The,,,
"ensuing weak growth, in turn, reduces fresh lending and slows the reduction in NPLs.14 The experiences",,,
"of countries in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE)15",,in the aftermath of the 2007–09,
global ﬁnancial crisis reveal the long-term problems and severer recessions that can result (see online,,,
annex 2A16). The increase in NPLs in the CESEE region was rooted in excess credit growth and lax under-,,,
"writing practices by banks, whereas in the COVID-19 crisis the pressures on asset quality arise from",,,
an unprecedented economic shock and restrictions in economic activity that aﬀect borrowers’ incomes,,,
and weaken their debt-weathering capacity. Another diﬀerence is that under the current circumstances,,,
governments’ ability to contain the impacts of the pandemic on ﬁrms and households aﬀects which bor-,,,
"rowers remain viable. Weaknesses in the macroeconomic, institutional, corporate, and banking sectors",,,
that have driven past crises are a factor as well.,,,
,The experiences of the CESEE countries following the global ﬁnancial crisis nonetheless clearly illus-,,
trate the dangers of a delayed initial policy response.17,,"By allowing the underlying problems to fester,",
countries compromised the capacity of their banking sector to ﬁnance the real economy and ultimately,,,
were left trapped in a bad equilibrium of low growth linked to a weak ﬁnancial system. Avoiding a repeat,,,
of this scenario is a priority for policy makers everywhere. Despite important diﬀerences in the two,,,
"crises in the underlying causes and the starting positions of individual countries, the key lesson from",,,
"the CESEE region, as well as from other regions and at other times, is that rising NPLs require a prompt,",,,
comprehensive policy response.,,,
,This negative cycle of high NPLs leading to low economic growth is not inevitable. Evidence compar-,,
ing countries that have proactively pursued strong measures to reduce the stock of NPLs in the wake of,,,
an economic crisis with those that have taken a more passive approach reveals that the former approach,,,
82,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,
results in superior economic and credit growth recovery.18 Sound ex ante policies play an important role,,,
"in preventing NPL problems from building, while robust corporate governance, eﬀective supervision,",,,
and regulation of banks facilitate NPL resolution. Policy makers and bankers can expedite ﬁnancial,,,

cial distress likely to result in repayment difficulties once support is withdrawn.19,Uncertainty about,,
future policy support—such as when moratoria will be lifted or whether new support may be added—,,,
may, create incentives for banks to hold back on detailed credit risk monitoring and management of,,
emerging loan performance problems as they wait for additional information. This situation may only,,,
amplify the incentives for a bank to underestimate the deterioration of its asset quality. It will then,,,
"report a stronger ﬁnancial position because as soon as it classiﬁes loans as under- or nonperforming, it",,,
"must set aside provisions for anticipated credit losses, which lowers earnings and absorbs capital. These",,,
incentives are stronger for lower-capitalized banks—losses may signal ﬁnancial weakness and trigger,,,
supervisory intervention and the need for new capital.20,This context of uncertainty and mixed incen-,,
tives puts the onus on supervisors to establish a set of requirements for the asset quality indicators that,,,
banks must monitor and share.,,,
But setting such requirements is complicated. And national practices vary for many reasons.21 None-,,,

84,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,
"to assess borrowers’ payment performance and capacity, and thus the quality of the bank’s loan assets,",,,,
"are essential elements of strong bank management and eﬀective supervision (see table 2.1), particularly",,,,
"in emerging markets that tend to have relatively simple, bank-centric ﬁnancial systems.26",,,Drawing on,
"the 2019 Bank Regulation and Supervision Survey (BRSS), which uses 2016 data, table 2.1 summarizes",,,,
key features of asset classiﬁcation systems in emerging economies prior to the guidance supplied by,,,,
the BCBS.27,"Most respondents deployed a consistent asset classiﬁcation scheme, applied the principle",,,
"that the availability of collateral does not aﬀect the classiﬁcation of loan performance, and required",,,,

Such indicators underpin ﬁnancial statements recording performance as well as ﬁnancial strength.,,,,
Indicators of deteriorating asset quality also serve as an early warning system for loan performance,,,,
problems. They enable banks to take preemptive action to resolve problems and avoid the deadweight,,,,
costs of nonperforming assets. Supervisory authorities also rely on asset quality data and corresponding,,,,
measures of capital strength to gauge a bank’s capacity to absorb credit losses and its ability to supply,,,,

Guarding against incentives for mismeasurement,,,
"Banks underreport the magnitude and extent of asset quality problems in several ways. For example,",,,
they may delay recognizing the failure of particular borrowers to pay and instead evergreen loans by,,,
simply rolling them over at maturity to “extend and pretend” rather than designate the loan as past due,,,
"and nonperforming. Even when a bank has recognized that a borrower is facing a repayment problem,",,,
it may underrecord the severity of the problem in the hope that the borrower’s repayment capacity will,,,
improve over time. A bank may also place a high value on the collateral posted as security for a loan,,,
"instead of seeking additional protection when market values decline. Meanwhile, banks can obscure",,,
their exposure to problem loans by transferring NPLs to oﬀ–balance sheet affiliates not reported in their,,,
consolidated ﬁnancial position. Because this act is often conducted less than transparently to escape,,,
"supervisory scrutiny, consolidated and cross-border supervision are particularly important in curbing",,,
this kind of arbitrage. Supervisors will need to develop a full understanding of ﬁnancial groups’ busi-,,,
"ness(es) and main shareholders, economic interests, and intragroup transactions following the principle",,,
of economic substance over legal form.,,,
Incentives to underplay the true extent of exposure to problem loans will likely increase as morato-,,,
ria end and other support measures are phased out. Weak banks face a particularly strong incentive to,,,
disguise problems because full recognition of credit losses may push their capital below the regulatory,,,
"requirements, triggering reputational risks, an adverse impact on the costs and availability of funding,",,,
as well as heightened scrutiny and supervisory intervention to restore the bank’s position.30,,,
"If not countered by strong bank internal governance and intense, intrusive bank supervision, such",,,
incentives can create signiﬁcant discrepancies between reported asset quality ﬁgures and the underlying,,,
"economic realities, as illustrated by the asset quality reviews (AQRs) in countries facing banking stress",,,
"in the aftermath of the global ﬁnancial crisis.31 For example, following the AQR by the European Central",,,
"Bank (ECB) when it assumed responsibility for banking supervision,32",a special diagnostic review con-,,
ducted in Serbia in 2015 identiﬁed an additional 4.7 percentage points of NPLs in the total loan book,,,
(lowering the capital adequacy ratio by 1.76 percentage points).33,"Similarly, an AQR in India in 2015–16",,
identiﬁed an additional 2.5 percentage points of bank advances as nonperforming.34 AQRs may become,,,
"useful once there is more clarity about the longer-term economic impact of the pandemic. At this point,",,,
"not all businesses are fully operational, relief measures are still in place, and there is major uncertainty",,,
about the ultimate credit losses stemming from the COVID-19 crisis.,,,
Recognizing the role of supervision,,,
"Bank supervisors play a key role in establishing and upholding consistent, robust standards of credit risk",,,
management and loan asset classiﬁcation. Policy makers and academics agree about the importance of,,,
"strong, independent banking supervision in maintaining public trust in the banking system. The role of",,,
supervisors is especially important under the current circumstances because the growing pressures on,,,
asset quality may require them to take ﬁrm action.,,,
"After the global ﬁnancial crisis, the supervisory community strengthened frameworks for identifying",,,
and managing problem assets. The BCBS reinforced its “Core Principles for Eﬀective Banking Super-,,,
"vision,” which set out a minimum baseline for sound practices designed to be of universal applicability",,,

"for all countries. To facilitate global application, the principle of proportionality underlying the require-",,
ments recognizes that practices should be commensurate with the risk proﬁle and systemic importance,,
of the banks being supervised (see spotlight 2.1 for a discussion of the challenges facing microﬁnance,,
institutions and their supervisors).35,,
,"The principles lay out clear expectations about the treatment of problem assets, provisions, and",
"reserves, which were strengthened as part of the overall reinforcement.36",,They clarify that supervisors
"should be granted, and where necessary apply, powers and remedial measures to ensure that loan clas-",,

iﬁcation entails conveying powers to a supervisor to require higher provisions when judged necessary,,
and to set additional capital requirements to cover the risks of high levels of NPLs where remediation,,
"strategies appear weak.37 Notwithstanding the recent improvements, further progress in strengthening",,
approaches in this area remains a priority. Detailed assessments of supervisory practices and processes,,
undertaken during the joint World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Sector Assess-,,
ment Program (FSAP) reveal that supervisors continue to fall short in meeting the standards of sound,,
practice.38 Undertaking a speedy self-assessment of conformance to the high-level criteria set out for the,,
identiﬁcation and management of problem assets may help authorities to make the needed improve-,,
ments in view of the pervasive weaknesses in supervisory frameworks and the pressing urgency from,,
the pandemic.,,
,"Although supervisory reporting has been streamlined during the pandemic, banks must frequently",
"report reliable, detailed, up-to-date information on credit quality. This information should cover the",,
performance of loans that have beneﬁted from borrower relief measures in order to contribute to ,,
high-quality prudential supervision and broader policy analysis of the impact of the pandemic. Super-,,
visors can also build on their information base using high-frequency digital data on economic activ-,,
"ity and ﬁnancial prospects, as well as technology that facilitates analysis of data from a wide range of",,
"sources (see box 2.2). To support this process, credit bureaus, lenders, and supervisory authorities in",,
some countries are exploring and expanding the use of alternative credit data such as account data,,
"and rental data (when permitted by the customer), in combination with advanced digital technology, to",,
"enhance the accuracy of credit scoring. The results have been positive, although the need to ensure com-",,
pliance with consumer protection and privacy regulations remains critical (see chapter 4).39 Techniques,,
such as stress tests may also supplement ﬁnancial analysis and help identify emerging risk exposures.,,
,"Even where moratoria are still in place, supervisors should encourage banks to undertake thorough",
assessments of borrowers’ likeliness to pay. Moratoria dampen signals of deterioration in repayment per-,,
"formance. Credit assessments can thus inform decisions on the need for, as well as the terms of, restruc-",,
turing loans to viable borrowers. They can also guide early actions by banks to enforce and recover,,
their claims when borrowers face high risks of insolvency. Banks should be required to perform periodic,,
assessments and report a set of standard indicators on credit risk (such as the availability and quality,,
"of collateral and the repayment behavior prior to the pandemic). Using these indicators, supervisors",,
can monitor the performance of these loans. Such information will contribute to policy judgments on,,
"whether to temporarily extend loans and on targeting of moratoria, regulatory, and supervisory mea-",,
"sures, as well as additional borrower support.40 ",,
,Although the questions of when and how to phase out measures such as moratoria do not have simple,
"answers, the general principle should be to unwind them as soon as economic circumstances and the",,
pandemic allow. Decisions on extensions of moratoria should also be based on a thorough understanding,,
"of the ﬁnancial position and debt-carrying capacity of borrowers. And not least, the ﬁnancial impact of",,
moratoria on banks needs to be carefully considered. An extension implies that banks must forego regu-,,
"lar debt repayments on a possibly signiﬁcant part of their loan portfolio, which may aﬀect their liquidity.",,

tutional base.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The second step is to introduce NPL regulatory deﬁnitions aligned with international standards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many emerging economies entered the pandemic with weakly deﬁned NPLs and generous allowances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that enabled banks to avoid rigorous loan classiﬁcations through questionable restructuring practices.51 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some countries, these allowances were further weakened in response to the pandemic. It is important",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to revert to prepandemic standards as soon as possible, while mapping out a transition to deﬁnitions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aligned with international standards. In addition to the hard backstop of 90 days past due, standards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should include the qualitative unlikely-to-pay (UTP) criterion and forbearance deﬁnitions aimed at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
preventing low-quality loan restructuring that aims to delay recognition of inevitable credit losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although application of the UTP criterion will require an element of judgment by banks, supervisors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should ensure that banks proactively apply consistent approaches to making that assessment and clas-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sify loans and provision accordingly on this basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

92,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also have the skills needed to challenge common practices that banks often use to underrepresent NPLs,",,,
"such as overvalued collateral, “extend and pretend” loan restructuring, and transfers of losses to uncon-",,,
"solidated but de facto affiliated entities. Moreover, supervisors will need to understand the broader busi-",,,
ness interests of the bank’s owners. Rigorous application of high-quality corporate governance standards,,,
and constraints on lending to related parties are essential steps.,,,
"In the most challenged countries, reforms along these lines will take time and must be sustained",,,
"over several years. Although the task can seem daunting, the rewards will be plentiful. Indeed, in",,,
recent years some countries have made remarkable progress in a comparatively short period of time.,,,
"For example, with extensive World Bank support Uzbekistan introduced a new banking law in 2019",,,
to prepare authorities for the transition to a banking sector with a more prominent role for private,,,
capital. The law established a “gatekeeper function” aimed at giving the central bank expanded pow-,,,
ers to ensure that private investors seeking to enter the banking sector met common ﬁt and proper,,,
"standards, de facto ownership structures are well understood and monitored continually, and related",,,
party lending would be contained. Another priority was to allow the central bank to legally exercise,,,
supervisory judgment in fulﬁlling its mandate in the face of dynamically evolving banking risks. This,,,
change was a drastic and sometimes controversial one because the former legal framework prioritized,,,
compliance checks with administrative requirements over the mitigation of risks. The new banking,,,
law has had a galvanizing eﬀect on ﬁnancial sector reform in Uzbekistan. Building on the momentum,,,
"for ﬁnancial sector reform, the World Bank has continued to support the central bank in overhauling",,,
the corpus of prudential regulations and undertaking extensive capacity building to upgrade super-,,,
visory practices.52,,,
Building capacity to manage rising volumes of bad debts,,,
"In normal times, banks routinely manage NPLs. They know their clients and their capacity to repay and",,,
"thus are in the best position to restructure, collect, and sell NPLs. Bank capacity to manage NPLs may",,,
"be insufficient when the volume of NPLs increases signiﬁcantly across the board, which is very likely in",,,
response to the pandemic. Strengthening the capacity of banks to deal with NPLs is critical because of,,,
"the urgency of addressing bad debts. The recovery prospects for bad loans diminish quickly, and delays",,,
"in the initial policy response will allow the underlying problems to build, with the risk of overwhelming",,,
banks once pressures on asset quality begin to increase.,,,
"Methods to manage, recover, and resolve NPLs",,,
"Banks can reduce NPLs through a combination of loan restructuring, legal action, write-oﬀ, and sale to",,,
third parties (see table 2.2).53,Bank decisions about how they manage NPLs and when to escalate from,,
one method to another should be guided by the expected asset recovery for each method using net pres-,,,
ent value (NPV) calculations.54 These calculations should be based on conservative estimates for recov-,,,
"ery, discount rates, and carrying costs. Poorly functioning insolvency regimes, for example, translate",,,
into lower recovery rates that banks must reﬂect in their calculations.,,,
Challenges in addressing NPLs in practice,,,
"The ease with which banks can work out, collect, write oﬀ, or sell bad loans depends on the strength of",,,
"the enabling environment, particularly the strength of creditor rights, enforcement mechanisms, and",,,

creating large volumes of small retail loans that are labor-intensive to resolve (see box 2.4).,,,,,,,,,,
Banks may not have the skills or incentives to build their internal NPL workout capacity. Some,,,,,,,,,,

Public AMCs oﬀer important beneﬁts to banks and regulators seeking to resolve high NPL levels.76 ,,
"Besides removing problem loans from bank balance sheets, public AMCs give regulators additional lever-",,
age to force banks to recognize credit losses—an important step toward restoring public conﬁdence in,,
the banking sector and a critical one in countries where the integrity of reported indicators of asset,,
"quality is little trusted. Meanwhile, because of their size and specialization in certain kinds of loans and",,

omies of scale in the management of distressed assets and greater cost efficiency. This is particularly,,
"true if public AMCs can focus on a set of large, complex loans, such as those for real estate development.",,
"In addition, by gathering a large volume of homogeneous, distressed assets, public AMCs can help to",,
"overcome complex, multicreditor collective action problems and package the assets for sale to outside",,
"specialist investors. Public AMCs beneﬁt from enhanced bargaining power with both buyers and sellers,",,
"and from having time to realize the value of these assets, thereby avoiding the unnecessary losses associ-",,
ated with ﬁre sales. Setting up a public AMC requires the availability of ﬁscal resources because ﬁnance,,
ministries typically provide (part of) the initial capital and often a partial guarantee on the bonds that,,
banks receive in exchange for the transferred assets.,,
"Achieving these beneﬁts requires a well-designed public AMC, and this is an area in which emerging",,
"economies have experienced serious challenges. Without an appropriate design, public AMCs can be",,
"vulnerable to political interference in the form of pressure to support well-connected borrowers, stra-",,
"tegic sectors, or state-owned enterprises; pressure to include political appointees rather than seasoned",,

"prices, which gives banks a subsidy and discourages them from adhering to strong underwriting prac-",,
tices when they originate loans. The outcome could be a buildup of signiﬁcant contingent liabilities for,,
taxpayers. Emerging economies have also struggled to make public AMCs time-bound. Sunset clauses,,
help to encourage banks to quickly transfer bad loans to a public AMC and incentivize public AMCs to,,
"work out these assets within a reasonable time frame, mitigating the risk that they become warehouses",,
for bad assets.,,
"In summary, although a public AMC is an option for NPL resolution, it is not a silver bullet. Public",,
AMCs are most eﬀective when they focus on a relatively homogeneous pool of large corporate loans;,,
"include a sunset clause; embrace robust governance, transparency, and disclosure arrangements; and are",,
"embedded in a comprehensive NPL resolution strategy, as advocated throughout this chapter.",,
Dealing with problem banks,,
"Despite the best eﬀorts of banks and governments to prepare for rising NPLs, some banks—especially",,
if they were weak or failing before the pandemic—may be unable to absorb the additional pressure.,,
"Dealing expeditiously with these banks is essential to support a strong, sustainable recovery. A powerful",,
lesson from previous episodes of severe banking stress is that delay is costly for two interrelated reasons.,,
"First, delay typically increases the scale of the problem.77",,Weak banks generally become weaker absent
remedial action: they face both higher funding costs and the risk of losing higher-quality clients and,,

"gion across the system, and ﬁnancial crisis. Second, weak banks tend to both misallocate and restrict the",,
"supply of credit, which hold back the recovery and dampen future growth.78 Preserving ﬁnancial system",,
health by quickly addressing any bank distress that arises is critical to ensure the efficient and prompt,,
100,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
provision of the credit needed to spur investment and to foster employment and growth as economies,,
recover from the pandemic.,,
Building capital strength to absorb losses and finance recovery,,
Banks were encouraged during the pandemic to utilize buﬀers above the minimum regulatory stan-,,
"dards—notably, countercyclical capital buﬀers designed to be released in a downturn. Use of such buf-",,
fers enables banks to continue to extend credit to viable ﬁrms facing temporary stress and to ﬁnance,,
"new, productive investment, while also absorbing the pressures from weakening asset quality.79",Yet the,
"amount of capital available varies across banks and countries, creating diﬀerences in the ability of banks",,
to play this supportive role.80,,
"In the years following the global ﬁnancial crisis, many banks strengthened their balance sheets and",,
"built up capital and liquidity buﬀers, buttressed by the toughening of global regulatory standards.81",,As
"highlighted earlier, however, reported capital adequacy ﬁgures must be interpreted with some caution",,
"because of the possibility of underreported credit risk, which inﬂates measured capital. In addition, in",,
some countries the improvement in reported capital adequacy ratios may have been driven by a shift in,,
"bank lending toward assets that carry a low risk weight.82 Nonetheless, the consensus is that regulatory",,
"reforms have, on the whole, contributed to stronger buﬀers that have helped banks weather the crisis",,
and continue to provide credit.,,
"In countries with banking systems suﬀering from preexisting vulnerabilities, however, pressures",,
from a sharp increase in problem loans may be increasingly difficult to absorb. Although reported NPLs,,
"and capital measures currently seem reassuring, credit losses may increase rather quickly once morato-",,
"ria are discontinued, aﬀecting capital. The phasing out of public credit guarantee schemes could exacer-",,
"bate these pressures because banks would face increasing risk.83 Over time, some banks may struggle to",,
"meet capital adequacy requirements, creating the need for viable capital restoration and recovery plans",,
"to retain market conﬁdence. And indeed, some banks will be at risk of failing, potentially jeopardizing",,
ﬁnancial stability if authorities do not quickly and carefully resolve them.,,
Taking early action to bolster the capital strength of the banking system helps to guard against under-,,
"capitalization and potential distress. In this vein, some countries have used favorable global ﬁnancing",,
"conditions as a window of opportunity to raise capital. Furthermore, utilizing this window to raise ",,
longer-term ﬁnance would also strengthen the funding position of banks that draw on external whole-,,
"sale markets as a source of ﬁnance. In countries such as India, market conditions were sufficiently favor-",,
"able to support raising bank capital during the pandemic. Moreover, at the outset of the pandemic many",,
authorities took action to encourage the preservation of capital by temporarily limiting and restricting,,
bank dividend payments.84 Although the restriction temporarily reduces shareholder cash ﬂow and may,,
"increase the cost of raising new equity, it sustains reserves within the bank to absorb potential losses.85 ",,
"Some authorities subsequently lifted these restrictions for demonstrably strong banks, but retaining the",,
restrictions during the continuing high uncertainty would provide helpful additional capital buﬀers.,,
Recent evidence suggests that a failure to respond speedily and eﬀectively to an undercapitalization of,,
the banking system can be very costly to an economy.86 In addition to causing broader ﬁnancial instabil-,,
"ity, weak banks with little chance of recovery tend to take excessive risks. With little to lose, they “gamble",,
for resurrection” in the hope that an unlikely bet will pay oﬀand thus allow the bank’s survival.87,,But
"the costs and downsides of such risk-taking are borne by depositors and other creditors, not by bank",,
"management and shareholders. Moreover, such behavior aﬀects the sustainable pricing of risk and thus",,
"could spill over and distort decisions by healthy banks. Finally, as noted earlier, weak banks are more",,
RESOLVING BANK ASSET DISTRESS,|,101
likely than strong banks to misallocate credit by continuing to support insolvent borrowers (zombie,,
"lending) in the faint hope they will eventually recover and by restricting credit to new, productive uses",,
to preserve dwindling capital.88,,
"To guard against the risk of a lackluster recovery due to weak and distorted credit availability, bank",,
"supervisors should intensify their monitoring and analysis of individual banks, in addition to the overall",,
banking system’s ﬁnancial position and outlook. Beyond the usual wide range of tools for monitoring,,
"and evaluation, including ﬁnancial analysis, scenario analysis, and stress tests, supervisors can draw on",,
the tools needed to measure longer-term ﬁnancial risks (such as climate-related and environmental) to,,
align with emerging international good practices.89,,Upon detecting an impending breach of the regu-
"latory capital standard, supervisors should urgently conduct an in-depth assessment rather than rely",,
mechanically on the automatic supervisory triggers embedded in some regulatory systems. An in-depth,,
assessment will reveal whether the breach is temporary and resolvable with a viable plan to restore ,,
capital strength over the medium term under strict supervisory oversight.,,
The credibility and feasibility of medium-term recapitalization and restoration plans to facilitate,,
"recovery from the pandemic will vary according to characteristics such as ownership structure, ﬁnan-",,
"cial position and business model of the bank, ﬁnancial market conditions, and economic outlook. For",,
"domestic, privately owned banks, recapitalization prospects are likely to depend heavily on market",,
"conditions and the risk appetite of investors, which, in turn, will depend on the bank’s business plan",,
and the outlook for the banking system. Although the same variables will inﬂuence the recapitalization,,
"prospects for subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks, the ﬁnancial position and business strategy of the",,
parent bank may be a stronger driver.90,,"In ﬁnancial sectors dominated by a state bank, the ability to"
"transfer losses to private creditors, shareholders, or uninsured depositors is limited. Governments are",,
"thus directly exposed to ﬁnancial sector losses, underscoring the critical role played by eﬀective super-",,
"visory and ﬁnancial stability frameworks, as well as a proper separation of ownership and supervisory",,
functions to minimize conﬂicting objectives. Decisions on recapitalizing state-owned banks may ﬁgure,,
"in the overall government policy response, depending on the perceived role of such banks in the ﬁnancial",,
"system, as well as on available ﬁscal resources and government debt sustainability.",,
Strengthening frameworks to address bank failures,,
The 2007–09 global ﬁnancial crisis vividly demonstrated the inadequacies of the banking regulatory,,
and supervisory frameworks at the time for dealing with bank failures. The standard corporate insol-,,
vency framework had limited options for addressing the speciﬁc issues raised by banking sector prob-,,
lems and proved ill-suited to address signiﬁcant failures because of the tight ﬁnancial and reputational,,
connections within the ﬁnancial sector and associated risks of contagion. How to maintain conﬁdence,,
in the banking sector and how to sustain access to funds and ensure continuity of key ﬁnancial services,,
are two questions that must be answered to manage failing banks.,,
"Moreover, deposit-taking banks fundamentally diﬀer from nonﬁnancial companies and thus require",,
"diﬀerent approaches to insolvency.91 Unlike failures of nonﬁnancial companies, bank failures can gener-",,
ate signiﬁcant wealth losses across the economy (such as by uninsured depositors) and can be associated,,
"with a disruption in the provision of critical ﬁnancial services. In addition, a failed bank may cause",,
"knock-on eﬀects that may destabilize the rest of the ﬁnancial system by, for example, producing loss of",,
"depositor conﬁdence and runs on multiple banks, lack of access to key banking services, and impacts",,
on ﬁnancial counterparties and markets. It is therefore problematic in the context of ﬁnancial institu-,,
tions that corporate insolvency measures can generally only be initiated at the point of insolvency. This,,
timing would inhibit an early and decisive preemptive intervention designed to forestall banking sector,,
102,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
problems that may quickly become systemic. Another limitation of the corporate insolvency frame-,,,
work when applied to ﬁnancial institutions is that it does not recognize the particular position of bank,,,
"depositors, who, unlike creditors of nonﬁnancial companies, are numerous and not professional market",,,
"participants, and who have claims on banks that play a major role in the wider functioning of the econ-",,,
omy. Application of the corporate insolvency law could thus aggravate systemwide losses and jeopardize,,,
ﬁnancial stability.92 ,,,
The expectation that public authorities will step in to prevent bank failure and preserve ﬁnancial,,,
"stability creates moral hazard, whereby banks increase leverage and take excessive risks, assuming they",,,
"will beneﬁt from the potential upside, while taxpayers underwrite potential major losses on the down-",,,
side.93,"Thus for regulators, the introduction of eﬀective crisis management frameworks has been an",,
"important priority in recent years, complementing the multiple initiatives to strengthen the resilience of",,,
ﬁnancial institutions and the system as a whole. The overarching objective has been to resolve ﬁnancial,,,
"institutions without severe systemic disruption and with minimal exposure of taxpayers to losses, while",,,
sustaining vital economic functions and preserving ﬁnancial stability.,,,
"International guidelines are useful in developing and implementing national frameworks. In 2014,",,,
the Financial Stability Board issued “Key Attributes of Eﬀective Resolution Regimes for Financial Insti-,,,
"tutions,” together with guidance on information sharing and sector-speciﬁc implementation.94 The FSB",,,
"framework deﬁnes the powers and associated legal safeguards, funding arrangements, and requirements",,,
for planning and cross-border cooperation needed to facilitate eﬀective bank resolution. In parallel with,,,
"international eﬀorts to strengthen bank resolution schemes, the International Association of Deposit",,,
Insurers (IADI) developed core principles for deposit insurance schemes.95,,,
"Institutional and legal arrangements that vest in a national agency the responsibility, intervention",,,
"powers, and tools required to undertake an orderly resolution of failing banks are pivotal. The desig-",,,
nated resolution authority (either an existing agency or a new one) should be given the legal authority,,,
"to pursue ﬁnancial stability by initiating resolution when it judges that a bank is, or is likely to be, no",,,
longer viable and has no reasonable prospect of becoming so.96,The resolution authority should have,,
"policy options and tools at its disposal, including stabilization options that support the continuity of",,,
key ﬁnancial functions and liquidation options that enable the orderly winding down of parts or all of a,,,
"ﬁrm’s business. As also described in table 2.3, the main tools would be the following:",,,
• ,Partial asset and liability transfer (also known as purchase and assumption). The resolution authority,,
,"transfers the insured deposit book to a healthy bank, typically alongside a corresponding volume",,
,of performing assets. The remaining “bad” book of the failing bank can then be wound down,,
,over time.,,
• ,Bridge bank. The resolution authority transfers performing assets and a proportion of liabilities,,
,"to a government-owned bridge bank, while the remaining book is liquidated. The bridge bank",,
,can subsequently be sold or privatized.,,
• ,Bail-in. The resolution authority has the power to write down and convert loss-absorbing liabili-,,
,ties of the bank in resolution into equity.,,
• ,"Liquidation. The resolution authority has the power to liquidate part or all of a bank’s book,",,
,enabling the separation and management of good assets and the continuity of key ﬁnancial ser-,,
,"vices, as well as supporting market discipline.",,
Strong safeguards are integral to resolution frameworks because the use of intervention tools over-,,,
rides shareholders’ and managers’ normal decision-making powers and aﬀects creditors’ interests. Key,,,
"safeguards are that the hierarchy of claims in liquidation must be respected, and no creditor will be",,,
"worse oﬀfrom undertaking the resolution than under the fallback option of liquidation. Otherwise,",,,

The FSB’s “Key Attributes” set out the international standard for bank resolution98,,,,,,,,,,and form part of,
the IMF and World Bank’s Standards and Codes Initiative and Financial Sector Assessment Program.,,,,,,,,,,,
Although many of the “Key Attributes” are broadly applicable to any bank resolution regime in any juris-,,,,,,,,,,,
"diction, some of the elements focus on the challenges in resolving complex, globally systemic banks with",,,,,,,,,,,
extensive cross-border operations. A recent World Bank paper provides advice and guidance on how the,,,,,,,,,,,
“Key Attributes” may be applied proportionately in light of the structure and complexity of banking sys-,,,,,,,,,,,
tems and the capacity of authorities to achieve the desired objective—ﬁnancial stability without loss of,,,,,,,,,,,
public funds—without imposing undue or unjustiﬁed operational burdens on authorities and ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,
institutions or creating market distortions.99 Thus some tailoring is needed.100 The following attributes,,,,,,,,,,,
"appear to be appropriate to all jurisdictions and all types of banks: the power to remove management,",,,,,,,,,,,
"appoint an administrator, operate and resolve a ﬁrm, override shareholder rights, transfer assets and",,,,,,,,,,,
"liabilities, suspend creditor payment, impose a temporary stay on early termination rights, and liquidate",,,,,,,,,,,
"an institution. However, the following attributes address issues found more commonly in large, complex",,,,,,,,,,,
"banks: the power to ensure continuity of essential services that support critical functions, to establish a",,,,,,,,,,,
"bridge bank, and to bail in shareholders and creditors.",,,,,,,,,,,
Planning for dealing with failing banks,,,,,,,,,,,
Planning is essential to ensure that the resolution authority has the information and tools to support,,,,,,,,,,,
orderly implementation.,,The “Key Attributes” require jurisdictions to establish an ongoing process for,,,,,,,,,
"recovery and resolution planning, covering, at a minimum, domestically incorporated ﬁrms that could",,,,,,,,,,,
have systemic impacts if they fail. Requiring major ﬁrms to produce robust recovery and resolution plans,,,,,,,,,,,
under authorities’ oversight is a must for eﬀective contingency planning.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the last decade, authorities worldwide have made signiﬁcant progress in developing and imple-",,,,,,,,,,,
menting resolution frameworks. They have also taken steps to strengthen other key aspects of the ﬁnan-,,,,,,,,,,,
"cial safety net, such as deposit insurance schemes, which help to support depositor conﬁdence in the",,,,,,,,,,,

A clear assessment of the extent of the asset quality problems and the potential capital shortfall in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
individual troubled banks and across the system as a whole is an important input into decisions on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether temporary public sector support is warranted. Banks should be adequately recapitalized to sup-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"permits, an independent asset quality review, as well as stress tests, may be helpful in supporting policy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decisions on bank capital recovery plans and in sizing any temporary public support. Strong safeguards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are essential to protect taxpayers’ interests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An important ﬁrst step is to ensure that all losses are recognized (and equity capital written down),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before any government capital injection to avoid bailing out shareholders. Governance and management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conclusion,,
Dealing promptly and comprehensively with distressed assets and problem banks is essential for a,,
"well-functioning banking system and healthy, sustainable growth. History has shown that a strong ini-",,
"tial response prevents problems from festering, maintains the capacity of the banking sector to ﬁnance",,
"the real economy, fosters market and public conﬁdence, and reduces the risk that countries become",,
trapped in an equilibrium of low growth and lackluster ﬁnancial sector performance.,,
Avoiding such a scenario should be a top priority. Replicating the full range of policies discussed,,
in this chapter may be particularly demanding for countries that face a combination of institutional,,
"constraints and serious preexisting ﬁnancial sector vulnerabilities. Under these circumstances, some",,
"sequencing of measures is likely to be necessary, while some of the more complex reforms may need to",,
be simpliﬁed.,,
"Whatever the situation, eﬀective resolution of the banking sector must begin with an accurate under-",,
standing of the scale of the problem. The starting point is full transparency about bank exposures to,,
"troubled assets, supported by a robust regulatory and supervisory framework so that banks properly",,
identify NPLs and provision for credit losses. Supervisors must ensure that banks have sufficient capital,,
"buﬀers to support lending growth and economic recovery, while absorbing credit losses to minimize ",,
the risk that insolvency problems materialize and become a threat to ﬁnancial stability. Encouraging,,
banks to use favorable global ﬁnancing conditions to strengthen capital and balance sheet resilience can,,
support this process.,,
"Some countries, however, entered the pandemic with lax regulatory deﬁnitions and ineﬀectual super-",,
"vision. In these countries, it is critical that regulators and supervisors do not succumb to pressures to",,
"further dilute regulatory standards and soften supervisory enforcement. Instead, they should consider",,
reversing any recent dilution of asset classiﬁcation deﬁnitions and developing and implementing a plan,,
for gradually introducing internationally agreed-on deﬁnitions for NPLs and forborne exposures to,,
ensure rigorous monitoring of banks’ asset quality. That eﬀort should be buttressed by ongoing eﬀorts,,
to strengthen the eﬀectiveness of supervision.,,
Supervisors should require banks with excessive NPL exposures to adopt NPL resolution strategies,,
and reinforce their operational readiness to resolve rising volumes of bad loans. The creation of dedi-,,
cated workout units tasked with handling problematic exposures is a good starting point. Banks will,,
also need to implement internal policies to manage and resolve NPLs and to assess the viability of dis-,,
tressed borrowers. The latter is vital to avoid questionable loan restructuring that delays the recognition,,
of inevitable credit losses.,,
"At the national level, the government should coordinate the participation of public and private sector",,
stakeholders and civil society representatives in resolving banking sector problems. Such institutional,,
coordination would be particularly useful in jurisdictions where eﬀorts to accelerate NPL resolution face,,

,,Restructuring firm ,,,,,,,,,
,,and household debt,,,,,,,,,
The,COVID-19–induced,economic,crisis,and,the,temporary,government,measures,intended,to,protect
ﬁrms and households from bankruptcy have created unprecedented opacity about the ﬁnancial health of,,,,,,,,,,,
"households and businesses. Some borrowers are temporarily short on liquid assets, while others are facing ",,,,,,,,,,,
"longer-term structural difficulties and should exit the market. The challenge, then, is sorting the illiquid from",,,,,,,,,,,
"the insolvent. Historically, court-led bankruptcy systems have performed this sorting function, and so these",,,,,,,,,,,
systems are scrutinized in times of ﬁnancial crisis. Eﬀective insolvency systems can help to quickly resolve high,,,,,,,,,,,
levels of debt distress to prevent collapse of the ﬁnancial sector without relying on costlier forms of policy,,,,,,,,,,,
intervention. Reforms to strengthen bankruptcy systems also improve the underlying economic conditions,,,,,,,,,,,
and so are critical to an equitable recovery. This chapter lays out a blueprint for bankruptcy reforms that will,,,,,,,,,,,
help governments manage high levels of debt distress while laying the groundwork for economic recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Policy Priorities,,,,,,,
Countries can mitigate the risk of an onslaught of insolvent households and businesses by investing in,,,,,,,,,,,
four policy reforms:,,,,,,,,,,,
• , Strengthening formal insolvency mechanisms so that the rules that deﬁne the rights and behaviors,,,,,,,,,,
,"of debtors and creditors are in place, giving each an incentive to negotiate and come to an agreement,",,,,,,,,,,
,whether in court or out of court.,,,,,,,,,,
•,Facilitating alternative dispute resolution systems such as conciliation and mediation to enable,,,,,,,,,,
,"faster and cheaper resolution of disputes than in the formal court system, but with some of the rigor",,,,,,,,,,
,that courts provide.,,,,,,,,,,
• , Establishing accessible and inexpensive in-court and out-of-court debt resolution procedures,,,,,,,,,,
,"for micro-, small, and medium enterprises to facilitate the recapitalization of viable but illiquid",,,,,,,,,,
,"ﬁrms and the swift, efficient market exit of nonviable ﬁrms. Rules designed for small entities can help",,,,,,,,,,
,resolve their debts more quickly and cheaply with less burden on the judicial system than requiring,,,,,,,,,,
,the same rules regardless of ﬁrm size.,,,,,,,,,,
•,Promoting debt forgiveness and discharge of natural person debtors so that solo entrepreneurs ,,,,,,,,,,
,and individuals unable to pay their debts—through no fault of their own—can be discharged of ,,,,,,,,,,
,"those debts and more quickly move on from them, avoiding the stigma and loss of productivity that",,,,,,,,,,
,come from long-term debt distress.,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction ,,,,,,
"Building on chapter 2 on ﬁnancial institutions, this chapter looks at the consumers of ﬁnance—house-",,,,,,
holds and ﬁrms—and especially at the insolvency systems countries can use in facilitating an equitable,,,,,,
recovery from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) economic crisis. Those systems—debt enforcement laws and,,,,,,
their institutional framework—are essential to achieving recovery. The reforms highlighted in this chap-,,,,,,
"ter, informed by the World Bank’s “Principles for Eﬀective Insolvency and Creditor/Debtor Regimes” and",,,,,,
the “Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law” issued by the,,,,,United Nations Commission on International,
"Trade Law (UNCITRAL),1 focus on mechanisms for restructuring or discharging debt.",,,,,,
"Eﬀective debt resolution, which these reforms facilitate, can contribute to economic growth and",,,,,,
 contain the wider economic impact of business distress. In addition to establishing fairness for debtors,,,,,,
"by providing a pathway out of perpetual indebtedness, well-functioning insolvency systems can spur",,,,,,
future innovation and economic growth by freeing up capital for lending to new and productive enter-,,,,,,
"prises. To deliver on this potential, insolvency systems have to ﬁnd an eﬀective balance between the",,,,,,
"need, on the one hand, to address individual instances of overindebtedness and, on the other, to dis-",,,,,,
courage borrowers from engaging in unnecessary risk-taking.,,,,,,
Why should anyone care about insolvency systems?,,,,,,
Financial crises typically draw attention to insolvency systems because they are an eﬀective way to man-,,,,,,
age and reduce high rates of nonperforming loans (NPLs).2,,,,,"However, this ex post argument for strong",
insolvency systems is accompanied by an ex ante justiﬁcation for pursuing insolvency reforms as well.3 ,,,,,,
"Improvements in insolvency systems are associated with greater access to credit,4",,,,,improved creditor,
"recovery, strengthened job preservation,5",,,,"higher productivity,6",and lower failure rates for small busi-,
nesses.7,,Cost-reducing reforms can also create the right conditions for nonviable ﬁrms to ﬁle for liq-,,,,
"uidation,8",,"which can help resolve the problem of so-called zombie ﬁrms, discussed shortly. In short, ",,,,
the rationale for reforms to strengthen insolvency frameworks in the COVID-19 era is a mix of crisis,,,,,,
management and recovery planning.,,,,,,
This chapter highlights the positive beneﬁts of insolvency systems (a primer on those systems appears,,,,,,
in box 3.1). But it is also important to recognize the risks of maintaining the status quo for those coun-,,,,,,
tries lacking sound insolvency systems. One characteristic of inadequate insolvency frameworks is the,,,,,,

and deterioration of the value of underlying assets. Long processes also delay the redeployment of capital,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tied up in nonviable ﬁrms to viable businesses and productive sectors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Nonviable zombie ﬁrms9,,,generate enough income to repay interest on outstanding debts but not,,,,,,,,,
enough to repay the outstanding debt balance. They drain productivity from the economy by absorbing,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resources that would produce better returns if they were used to ﬁnance healthier businesses.10 The rela-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tionship between insolvency systems and zombie ﬁrms is supported by empirical ﬁndings that higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,
barriers to restructuring are associated with “zombie congestion” in high-turnover industries and with a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lower ability to attract capital.11 Eﬀective insolvency systems reduce such barriers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Restructuring and forcing the market exit of zombie ﬁrms have signiﬁcant political economy dimen-,,,,,,,,,,,,
sions. Most important are the jobs lost by the employees of restructured or liquidated companies. Com-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plicating matters further, in the present crisis it is very difficult to distinguish between liquid and illiquid",,,,,,,,,,,,,
ﬁrms because even healthy ﬁrms have experienced a temporary collapse in liquidity.12,,,,,,,,,,,The COVID-19,,
emergency government measures aimed at preventing widespread business collapse have made this,,,,,,,,,,,,,
identiﬁcation process even murkier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,This difficulty was of little consequence in the short term because propping up both zombie ﬁrms,,,,,,,,,,,,
and viable ﬁrms likely produced economic beneﬁts in the form of continued employment for workers,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at zombie ﬁrms at a time when new job opportunities were severely limited. However, over the longer",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"term government measures that inhibit the exit of zombie ﬁrms should be removed, while recognizing",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that these actions may create other challenges. For example, simplifying the liquidation or restructuring",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"process for nonviable companies may produce rapid job losses in certain sectors, even as it creates higher",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"returns for creditors and releases more value into the economy. At scale, however, delaying liquidation or",,,,,,,,,,,,,
restructuring of zombie ﬁrms because of fears of job losses may be counterproductive. Actual job losses,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may also be less than feared: empirical evidence suggests that zombie ﬁrms tend to use loans to build up,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cash reserves instead of contributing to economic activity through hiring or spending.13 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The absence of eﬀective insolvency frameworks especially hurts small businesses and individuals. With-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out a working framework for restructuring debts, businesses experiencing a temporary inability to repay",,,,,,,,,,,,,
their loans are more likely to have to exit the market.14 Sole proprietors in countries that subject the propri-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
etors to personal bankruptcy regimes may face the threat of a lifetime of debt because of the unavailability,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of discharge (cancellation of debt).15,,,,"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly unincorporated",,,,,,,,,
"enterprises where the line between individual and business is blurred,16 are inherently more vulnerable to",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"insolvency because of their informality, low operating margins, and constrained access to credit (see spot-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
light 3.1 for a discussion of the microﬁnance institutions overcoming this constraint). SMEs are widespread,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in emerging economies, where the challenges of inadequate insolvency regimes are more pronounced.17 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Countries that lack eﬀective bankruptcy frameworks have limited options for dealing with high NPL,,,,,,,,,,,,
levels other than blunt public intervention. Governments may be forced to turn to borrower bailouts (in,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which the cost is borne by the taxpayer, insulating creditors) or bail-ins (in which the cost is borne by",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the creditor, insulating debtors and the taxpayer).18 For some industries or in some circumstances, these",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"approaches may be desirable,19 but they come with substantial risks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Studies of borrower bailouts suggest that the short-term beneﬁts of debt relief come with long-term,,,,,,,,,,,,
"costs. In particular, future borrowers may be more likely to engage in a strategic default in the belief that",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they will not have to repay, and creditors may, in turn, respond by restricting access to credit. Although",,,,,,,,,,,,,
some studies have found that debt relief programs can have positive welfare eﬀects and lead to positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"outcomes in certain cases,20 research indicates that, overall, the risk of future strategic loan default rises,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"especially among previously “good” borrowers, and there are no improvements in real outcomes.21",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,A study of debt relief in India in the wake of the global ﬁnancial crisis found a subsequent increase,,,,,,,,,,,,
in strategic default and a decrease in new lending to the sectors that were bailed out.22,,,,,,,,,,,,Another study,
of,a,mortgage,modiﬁcation,program,for,delinquent,borrowers,in,the,United,States,revealed,that
126,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,
announcement of the program was followed immediately by a 10 percent relative increase in delinquen-,,,,,,,,,,,
"cies, predominantly attributable to new delinquencies among borrowers otherwise deemed least likely",,,,,,,,,,,
"to default.23 Other studies showed the same—that previously “good,” or nondistressed, borrowers were",,,,,,,,,,,
more likely to strategically default or take longer to repay their loans after a bailout.24 Risks emerge for,,,,,,,,,,,
"the political economy of credit as well. In India, defaults were found to be sensitive to the electoral cycle,",,,,,,,,,,,
and the pattern was magniﬁed after the bailout.25,,,,,"Furthermore, borrowers who are angrier about the",,,,,,
"economic situation, who trust banks less, and who want to see more banking regulation are more likely",,,,,,,,,,,
to default strategically. Borrowers are more willing to default as knowledge of others defaulting and,,,,,,,,,,,
media coverage of the same become more widespread.26,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad hoc bailouts, as opposed to those conducted systematically, put governments in the position of",,,,,,,,,,,
picking winners—a skill they usually lack. The problems are compounded for emerging economies,,,,,,,,,,,
because there is less budget ﬂexibility for bailouts.27 The moral hazard risk may be exacerbated in juris-,,,,,,,,,,,
dictions in which declaring bankruptcy is not a viable alternative or even an option in the current legal,,,,,,,,,,,
framework.28,"Bail-ins, by contrast, are likely to increase the risk of ﬁnancial sector collapse and may",,,,,,,,,,
result in reduced future lending.29,,,,,,,,,,,
International,best,"practice,",empirical,"research,",and,lessons,from,previous,high-proﬁle,ﬁnancial ,
crises point to four critical areas for legal reform of insolvency: (1) strengthen formal insolvency mecha-,,,,,,,,,,,
nisms; (2) facilitate alternative dispute resolution systems such as conciliation and mediation; (3) estab-,,,,,,,,,,,
"lish accessible, inexpensive liquidation, in-court, and out-of-court procedures for micro-, small, and",,,,,,,,,,,
medium enterprises (MSMEs);30 and (4) promote debt forgiveness and discharge of natural person debt-,,,,,,,,,,,
ors. The remaining sections of this chapter address these four areas and elaborate on how to manage,,,,,,,,,,,
the expected increases in nonperforming loans in a way that enables an efficient and eﬀective recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,
Strengthening formal insolvency mechanisms,,,,,,,,,,,
A strong formal insolvency law regime is critical to the successful functioning of an insolvency system,,,,,,,,,,,
with both formal and informal options. Strong formal regimes have default rules and boundaries within,,,,,,,,,,,
"which creditors and debtors can mediate or otherwise negotiate debt outside, but “in the shadow” of,",,,,,,,,,,,
 formal insolvency law.31 Participants in out-of-court processes know how their case would be treated in,,,,,,,,,,,
"the in-court system and behave accordingly. Furthermore, if out-of-court bargaining fails, participants",,,,,,,,,,,
have recourse to the formal system. A strong formal system thus creates the right incentives and deﬁnes,,,,,,,,,,,
"the rights and behaviors needed to make both in-court and out-of-court workouts orderly, which, in",,,,,,,,,,,
"turn, spurs innovation and economic growth, as articulated in the introduction to this chapter.",,,,,,,,,,,
Both debtors and creditors should have incentives to engage with the insolvency system and partic-,,,,,,,,,,,
"ipate in good-faith negotiations. For creditors, the key incentives of a strong insolvency system include",,,,,,,,,,,
the possibility of negotiating an out-of-court debt restructuring plan that may yield a greater return,,,,,,,,,,,
than a forced liquidation. Eﬀective insolvency systems also enable creditors to feel secure in their rights.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus rather than resort to a unilateral approach, they are willing to coordinate with other creditors in",,,,,,,,,,,
the expectation that coordination will maximize returns.,,,,,,,,,,,
A strong insolvency regime creates incentives to negotiate a debt restructuring plan in good faith.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Creditors may make concessions, and the plan may open a path to the continued operation and turn-",,,,,,,,,,,
around of the indebted business. In regimes in which management loses control of the business once the,,,,,,,,,,,
"company enters administration, debtor companies may prefer to negotiate out of court to avoid losing",,,,,,,,,,,
"control of their business. If the court system provides an avenue for creditor recourse, debtors are also",,,,,,,,,,,
less likely to misbehave by using out-of-court processes to stall or defer repayment.,,,,,,,,,,,
"For these reasons, functioning insolvency laws underpin the reforms recommended in this chapter.",,,,,,,,,,,
"No one-size-ﬁts-all model will work in all jurisdictions and all circumstances. However, strong formal",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,RESTRUCTURING FIRM AND HOUSEHOLD DEBT,,,,,|,127
insolvency systems exhibit the following characteristics: (1) predictable creditor priority rules; (2) timely,,,,,,,,,,,
"resolution of insolvency proceedings; and (3) strong, accessible bankruptcy expertise among private",,,,,,,,,,,
practitioners and government officials.,,,,,,,,,,,

be implemented or improved within the multitude of extant frameworks worldwide—and there is,,,,,,,,,,,
empirical support to suggest they can improve the efficiency of insolvency regimes. These character-,,,,,,,,,,,
"istics are generally achieved by writing formal legal requirements into legislation, combined with the ",,,,,,,,,,,
"ongoing eﬀorts of adequately resourced institutions. For example, strict court deadlines written into an",,,,,,,,,,,
insolvency law to speed up the insolvency process may not work if there are not enough judges to hear,,,,,,,,,,,
cases within the speciﬁed time frame. These characteristics are an important part of the World Bank’s,,,,,,,,,,,
“Principles for Eﬀective Insolvency and Creditor/Debtor Regimes” and will be especially important in,,,,,,,,,,,
navigating the post–COVID-19 recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,
Role of the judiciary in the insolvency process,,,,,,,,,,,
A country typically relies on its judicial system to play a critical role in the insolvency process because of,,,,,,,,,,,
"the legal and procedural complexity of the issues and the need to balance the interests of debtors, cred-",,,,,,,,,,,
"itors (including employees), and the public at large. Even in well-functioning judicial systems, the time",,,,,,,,,,,
"between an application for liquidation and the ﬁnal distribution of funds to creditors can take years,",,,,,,,,,,,
"particularly for large companies with complex aﬀairs. For example, in Australia insolvency proceed-",,,,,,,,,,,
ings launched in 1991 for one set of companies were ﬁnally resolved in 2020. The main trial was held,,,,,,,,,,,
"between July 2003 and September 2006, consuming 404 days of court time. The 26,430-page judgment",,,,,,,,,,,
was drafted over two years.32 ,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Clearly, then, insolvencies can place heavy demands on court resources and time. Improving the legal",,,,,,,,,,
capacity to manage insolvency is therefore critical to economic recovery. A sudden rise in NPLs is likely,,,,,,,,,,,
"to strain even the most sophisticated, well-resourced, and well-structured judiciary33 because insolvency",,,,,,,,,,,
court cases require technical specialization and expertise.34,,,,,Without reforms to simplify and scale the,,,,,,
"process, judiciaries are likely to experience a case backlog, resulting in further delays.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Countries cannot aﬀord the delay. Longer court cases can reduce the value of assets and the ultimate,,,,,,,,,,
"recovery rate for creditors. Systemically, low recovery rates for creditors reduce the availability of credit",,,,,,,,,,,
"within an economy and raise its cost.35 Weak enforcement, or the perception of weak enforcement, that",,,,,,,,,,,
"may arise from backlogs can lead to late payments. They, in turn, can create further insolvencies for",,,,,,,,,,,
businesses connected within supply chains.36 ,,,,,,,,,,,
Characteristics of strong insolvency frameworks,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Predictable creditor priority rules,,,,,,,,,,
"Insolvency systems should provide clear, predictable rules of priority when there are competing claims",,,,,,,,,,,
for or interests in the same assets.37 Such rules facilitate an orderly process if a debtor is unable to repay,,,,,,,,,,,
"its debts, and they increase the appeal of a jurisdiction where investors have greater certainty about what",,,,,,,,,,,
will happen if the debtor fails to repay. Clear priority rules also beneﬁt other aspects of insolvency frame-,,,,,,,,,,,
"works. In particular, for out-of-court resolution to work eﬀectively in the shadow of the law, parties must",,,,,,,,,,,
know their rights and how their claims would be treated if they go to court.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Jurisdictions diﬀer widely in their priority rules, in the balance between debtor and creditor rights,",,,,,,,,,,
"and in the domestic policy choices and frameworks that underpin diﬀerent approaches. For example,",,,,,,,,,,,
"some jurisdictions treat employee entitlements as having no priority in the order of repayment, whereas",,,,,,,,,,,
128,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,
others give employees the highest priority. These matters are important policy and political choices for,,,
governments that may be inﬂuenced by other factors such as the existence of social safety nets for partic-,,,
"ular groups. Some frameworks give secured creditors absolute priority, while others give creditors that",,,
provide an illiquid business with fresh ﬁnancing higher priority than preexisting creditors.38 ,,,
,"Notwithstanding these variations, predictability can play an important stabilizing role in credit mar-",,
kets. A clear priority order that remains the same before and after the onset of insolvency proceed-,,,
"ings increases predictability and fairness, which can, in turn, increase the availability and lower the",,,
"cost of credit. On the other hand, the absence of clarity and predictability decreases the availability",,,
and increases the cost of credit because creditors factor the uncertainty into their decision-making or,,,
restrict their lending within a jurisdiction. If the law is not clear and predictable (such as on the relative,,,
"position of creditors), parties may also exploit the court system. For example, creditors may unilaterally",,,
"seek liquidation of a viable business, and debtors may seek to delay debt repayment or stall on relinquish-",,,
"ing control of their business. In the 1994 Mexican tequila crisis, systemic ﬁnancial sector weaknesses,",,,
"including those in the bankruptcy law, prolonged and frustrated repeated government eﬀorts to stabi-",,,
"lize and reduce NPLs. Ultimately, from a high of 30–45 percent in 2002, NPL rates only began to decline",,,
"meaningfully one year after comprehensive insolvency reforms were adopted. Around the same time,",,,
domestic credit began to rise again as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP) after having bottomed,,,
out at 12 percent in 2001 (see online annex 3A).39 ,,,
2,Timely resolution,,
Reducing the amount of time needed to satisfy creditors after the ﬁling for insolvency in court is a,,,
common target for reform because of the beneﬁts of moving faster.40,Timely resolution of insolvency,,
proceedings correlates strongly with higher returns to all creditors41 and allows the rapid redeployment,,,
"of capital from unproductive to productive enterprises.42 In this way, timely resolution creates a positive",,,
"feedback loop that motivates all actors to engage in out-of-court workouts, conﬁdent that, should the",,,
"situation escalate, in-court options are available and efficient.",,,
,One method commonly used by governments to resolve insolvency proceedings is the imposition of,,
time limits for some stages in the process. Many jurisdictions temporarily extended these time limits in,,,
the context of COVID-19 either through legislation or through a more lenient approach in the courts. ,,,
"For example, Australia extended the response time to a bankruptcy notice from 21 days to six months.43 ",,,
"In Mauritius in November 2020, the Supreme Court granted the administrators of Air Mauritius a long",,,
extension (seven months) to hold a watershed meeting.44 Extensions like these should be phased out as,,,
the recovery continues to prevent the perpetuation of zombie ﬁrms and facilitate the reallocation of,,,
capital from nonviable to viable ﬁrms (see chapter 1).,,,
,Divergent views among creditors are another source of delay. These can be managed with measures,,
that (with a court order) allow restructuring agreements to proceed without the support of all credi-,,,
"tors. In a “cramdown,” the majority of a creditor class binds the minority in that class. In a “cross-class",,,
" cramdown,” a majority in a creditor class binds a minority in other creditor classes. The United States",,,
"has cramdown mechanisms in place,45",and they were recently introduced in the United Kingdom.46 ,,
Momentum is growing for their introduction in other jurisdictions as well47—in some cases unrelated ,,,
to the COVID-19 pandemic.,,,
,Institutional capacity reforms can also speed up the insolvency process by clearing backlogs and,,
"increasing efficiency within the courts. For example, in Indonesia a judicial reform program enacted in",,,
the aftermath of the Asian ﬁnancial crisis helped to reduce the time needed to conclude SME insolvency,,,
"from 72 months in 2004 to 13 months in 2012.48 Among other reforms, responsibility for administration",,,
of the courts was transferred from the executive to the judicial branch; a centralized unit was established,,,
,RESTRUCTURING FIRM AND HOUSEHOLD DEBT,|,129
for judicial training and development; and commercial court judges with jurisdiction over insolvency,,
"cases received insolvency-speciﬁc training. Similarly, reforms to Chile’s insolvency law in 2014 included a",,
"requirement for insolvency law training for civil judges dealing with insolvency proceedings. As a result,",,
the time to resolve insolvency dropped from 3.2 years in 2014 to 2 years in 2018. The improvements in,,
"various metrics in India also demonstrate the value of institutional reforms like these, which are espe-",,
cially important to address the anticipated increase in judicial caseloads described earlier in this chap-,,
ter. Ongoing research and experimentation by the World Bank’s Data and Evidence for Justice Reform ,,
(DE JURE) project have pointed to the potential for improving the efficiency of judicial decision-making,,
through the use of data-based performance metrics (see online annex 3B).49 ,,
3,Expertise in bankruptcy,
"Expert practitioners, judges, and regulators are key to the success of well-designed insolvency legislation.",,
"Insolvency is a technical ﬁeld at the intersection of law, ﬁnance, and policy. The availability of workable",,
"valuation estimates of a business and its property is fundamental for avoiding a sell-oﬀ, if reorganiza-",,
"tion is intended. For judges, insolvency presents complex legal and factual matrixes. Countries attempting",,
"to develop these sorts of capacities should strive to develop sustainable institutional capacity, including",,
through ongoing training. Also critical are systems to oversee and regulate private bankruptcy profes-,,
"sionals, particularly in a crisis, when the opportunities for bankruptcy fraud and abuse of power are greater.",,
,"With this in mind, many economies have embarked on reforms to bolster the capacity of their judicia-",
"ries. Some have sought insolvency-speciﬁc reforms, while others have aimed to boost capacity generically",,
"(which will nonetheless have beneﬁts in the insolvency space). In Brazil, the National Justice Council",,
introduced standardized procedures for judicial reorganization proceedings during the COVID-19 pan-,,
demic.50 Spain announced its intention to create 100 additional judicial units within three years.51 Simi-,,
"larly, many countries have pursued or are pursuing judicial capacity-building programs in collaboration",,
"with the World Bank Group. These training programs educate judges about insolvency law, as well as",,
about practical aspects of their work such as case management and drafting judgments. Digitalization ,,
"is also increasing. For example, Nigeria has announced measures to deploy digital facilities to enable",,
taking evidence and alternative dispute-resolution ﬁling.52 ,,
,"Beyond technical capacity, an eﬀective insolvency regime requires stakeholder commitment. In the",
"aftermath of the 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis, the impact of insolvency reforms was limited by a “culture",,
"of non-payment” that, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-",,
"opment (OECD), prevailed in the aﬀected countries.53",,That culture emerged because borrowers rarely
"faced consequences when they failed to repay their loans. To prevent this type of situation, countries",,
"must embed speciﬁc rules in their broader legal, economic, political, and social contexts, and insol-",,
vency judges and practitioners must have access to the training needed to abide by and enforce the rules,,
correctly.,,
,"The institutional framework for insolvency includes courts and enforcement agencies, collateral reg-",
"istry and credit reporting systems, insolvency regulators, and insolvency practitioners. It requires judges",,
"able to interpret the law and manage caseloads. It also requires professionals (liquidators, administrators,",,
"receivers, conservators, and legal advisers) who have the technical ability to discharge their obligations",,
"to the court eﬀectively.54 In many cases, these bankruptcy professionals play a critical role in an efficient",,
"bankruptcy system. In many countries, they can be a key determinant of the speed of a reorganization.",,
The presence of professionals with skills in these areas will increase the efficacy of the reforms discussed,,
in the balance of this chapter because they will provide the solid formal legal foundation needed to facil-,,
itate out-of-court resolution of creditor-debtor disputes. Box 3.2 describes the comprehensive eﬀorts in,,
India to strengthen its institutional insolvency framework.,,

Strong insolvency frameworks in the context of COVID-19 recovery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In addition to the ﬁnancial measures adopted to staunch the worst of the damage from the COVID-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"economic crisis, many governments undertook temporary legal changes in their insolvency frameworks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to a joint World Bank/INSOL International survey spanning both advanced and emerging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"economies, 67 of the 69 surveyed economies enacted some insolvency reforms in 2020.58 The purpose of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the reforms was to “ﬂatten the curve” of insolvencies by creating breathing room for businesses, individ-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uals, and ﬁnancial institutions and preventing widespread economic collapse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most common reforms were relaxing debt repayment requirements (80 percent); placing mor-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atoria on the initiation of insolvency proceedings by creditors (43 percent); and altering or tempo-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rarily suspending the obligations of directors and ﬁrm managers to enter insolvency proceedings in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
circumstances in which they ordinarily would be required to do so (30 percent). Relaxed debt repay-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ment requirements included measures addressing borrowers’ diminished ability to make payments,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
such as moratoria on or extensions of loan repayment terms (about 34 percent); measures addressing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the eﬀects of nonpayment, such as prohibiting the acceleration of contractual terms (about 55 percent); ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
suspension,of,judicial,proceedings,(about,28,percent);,and,suspension,of,the,execution,of,certain ,
debtor-owned assets (about 4 percent).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2021, the World Bank designed a survey to identify the characteristics of corporate debt restructur-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing frameworks, as well as the types of insolvency-related COVID-19 emergency measures that jurisdic-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tions had introduced.59,,,The World Bank team worked with INSOL International and the International,,,,,,,,,,,
Association of Insolvency Regulators to distribute the survey.60,,,,,,,,Experienced insolvency professionals,,,,,,
"in 135 economies were contacted, and at least three independent contributors were contacted in 100",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jurisdictions. Responses were forthcoming from 114 economies, including multiple responses from 71",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
percent of those economies. The survey found that OECD economies introduced measures to stymie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
debtor (57 percent) or creditor (54 percent) bankruptcy ﬁlings more frequently than non-OECD econ-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"omies (24 percent and 17 percent, respectively). By contrast, debt repayment emergency measures (that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is, those contract modiﬁcation measures addressing either the prospects of repayment or the eﬀects of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nonpayment) as well as suspension of judicial procedures were more evenly distributed.61,,,,,,,,,,,This ﬁnding,,,
is consistent with the fact that advanced economies tend to have more robust insolvency systems and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
insolvency usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the insolvency-related emergency measures introduced after the onset of the pandemic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
included sunset clauses determining the timing for winding them down. Although many of these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facilitating alternative dispute resolution systems such as ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
conciliation and mediation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) systems will be an essential mechanism for economies seeking to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
emerge stronger after the COVID-19 pandemic. Eﬀective ADR frameworks allow quicker and cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"resolution of disputes than the formal court system, while retaining some of the rigor that courts pro-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vide.64 ADR in the insolvency context involves direct engagement between debtor and creditors to come,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to a resolution about an outstanding debt. ADR is typically, but not necessarily, overseen by a third party,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and any resolution is contractually binding. ADR can be initiated voluntarily by the parties or at the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"order of a court. Third-party mediators ideally facilitate, as opposed to actively participate in, the reso-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lution of intercreditor diﬀerences.65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of several structural obstacles to eﬀective ADR deployment in the insolvency context is the chal-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lenge of convincing multiple parties with varied interests to agree on a resolution that is consistent with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the obligations of the parties under the broader insolvency law. Before the pandemic, many countries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had already introduced or were in the process of introducing schemes that sought to facilitate ADR sys-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tems that addressed these challenges (see online annex 3C). Ideally, this trend will continue in the near",,,,,,,,,,,,,
to medium term—a possibility that underlies the guidance oﬀered in this section.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aristotle would likely have found ADR preferable to in-court proceedings because “an arbitrator goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the equity of a case, a judge by the strict law.”66 There is growing evidence that ADR can be cheaper,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quicker, and more satisfactory than court proceedings.67 In the insolvency context, out-of-court resolu-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion of debt disputes has the added advantage of occurring conﬁdentially, which allows participants to",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"avoid harm from public knowledge of debt distress, including constraints on capital and supply chains.68 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although the data on the efficacy of ADR in the context of insolvency are limited, a 2012 pilot program",,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the District Court of Amsterdam found that over 70 percent of cases resulted in successful solutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at greater speed and less cost when measured against the alternative—litigation.69,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An oft-cited example of a jurisdiction with a successful insolvency ADR regime is the United Kingdom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The “London approach,” a nonlegislative set of cultural norms and principles fostered by the Reserve",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bank,70",guides the manner in which creditors voluntarily and collectively approach debtor distress.,,,,,,,,,,,,
It does not require a third-party mediator or a conciliator. The London approach has four key tenets: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) creditors keep existing facilities in place and do not rush to appoint receivers; (2) reliable ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,,,
information about the debtor exists and is shared among creditors; (3) creditors work collectively to,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resolve the issue; and (4) the burden of debtor concessions is shared equally among creditors.71 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because of its informal, conﬁdential nature, limited empirical evidence is available on the merits",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of the London approach. It requires signiﬁcant creditor buy-in and cohesion. However, these may be",,,,,,,,,,,,,
lacking in jurisdictions without the requisite trust in debtors or the underlying system to enforce legal,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rights. For example, creditors from multiple jurisdictions may be unable or unwilling to attempt a coher-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
ent approach to the problem. Or they may be willing to make concessions only if other creditors make,,,,,,,,,,,,,
equivalent concessions. Thus creditors unwilling to make concessions can frustrate the process.72 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The,challenge,of,creditor,cohesion,has,been,addressed,in,some,jurisdictions,by,mechanisms ,
"that allow, in certain circumstances, for the courts to approve (and bind creditors to) restructuring",,,,,,,,,,,,,
plans negotiated outside of court. The French conciliation approach consists of a two-part model,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"toward this end. In the informal method (mandat ad hoc), the court appoints a representative to medi-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ate a nonbinding resolution of the debt distress. In the semiformal method (conciliation), the court",,,,,,,,,,,,,
approves and makes binding the output of mediation.73,,,,,,,"In practice, debtors tend to begin within the",,,,,,
mandat ad hoc framework and then proceed to conciliation to obtain court approval of the restructur-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ing agreement.74 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Several advanced economies have included variations on this model (court endorsement of out-of-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
court negotiations) in their COVID-19 reforms. Germany has introduced a new conciliation scheme,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Stabilization and Restructuring Framework) in which the debtor can apply for a court-appointed medi-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ator (“restructuring facilitator”) to assist in negotiations with creditors for up to three months. After suc-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cessful mediation, the court can conﬁrm the agreement, which protects the participants from avoidance",,,,,,,,,,,,,
or liability claims.75 The Netherlands has introduced reforms that enable debtors to oﬀer their creditors,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"restructuring plans outside of the formal bankruptcy procedure. If approved by a court, these plans can",,,,,,,,,,,,,
bind unwilling creditors (including secured creditors) to a restructuring arrangement in a cross-class,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another way of managing the problem of creditor cohesion is use of an intercreditor agreement—a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"contract among creditors—that sets the general rules for approaching restructuring, while allowing",,,,,,,,,,,,,
ﬂexibility for individual restructuring. A recent example of this approach is Turkey’s updated Framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poland’s experience demonstrates how the adoption of out-of-court restructuring can quickly ,,
take the heat out of widespread and rising NPL levels and lay the foundation for future economic,,
health by putting banks on a ﬁrmer footing to extend new credit. As part of a larger eﬀort in the,,
"early 1990s to establish a market-based economy, Poland adopted the Act on Financial Restructuring",,
of Enterprises and Banks.77,,"In eﬀect until 1996, this legal framework for insolvency was intended"
to supplement formal bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings when the state-owned national bank,,
was split into nine commercial banks—a step that revealed high levels of nonperforming loans in,,
the banks’ portfolios.78,,The act empowered ﬁnancial institutions to design and implement a process
for restructuring enterprises through which they brokered conciliation agreements with debtors and,,
divested NPLs on the secondary market.79,,The banks received an inﬂux of capital to facilitate the
restructuring process.80 ,,
"By mid-1995, about 85 percent of the conciliation agreements had been ﬁnalized.81",,Common fea-
"tures of the agreements included debt write-oﬀs or extensions of the payment period, more favorable",,
"terms for small creditors, and debt-for-equity swaps (in about one-third of cases). Less than 1 per- ",,
"cent of borrowers were required to make immediate partial payments. Meanwhile, the more viable",,
"ﬁrms (23 percent) went into conciliation, while the ﬁnancially weaker ﬁrms went into liquidation or",,
court bankruptcy.,,
"The ﬁrms that entered bank conciliation accounted for 46 percent of the debt owed at the end of 1991,",,
"reﬂecting the unequal distribution of debt within the economy. Overall, thanks to the Polish concilia-",,
"tion scheme the NPL rates of bank portfolios fell rapidly, from 31 percent in 1993 to 9 percent in 1996.82 ",,
"Loans were written down or swapped without widespread debt forgiveness,83",,leaving banks in a better
position to extend new loans on market-oriented terms.,,
"Despite these improvements, the increase in conciliation and restructuring alone failed to address the",,
underlying problems of ﬁrm mismanagement and unproﬁtability. Restructuring plans did not require,,
"changes in management or operational restructuring, and less than half of ﬁrms committed to asset",,
"sales or reduction of staﬀ. As a result, during the ﬁrst two years of implementation businesses subject to",,
"conciliation saw their average operating proﬁt decline, and few were privatized. Because MSMEs were",,
"excluded from the conciliation scheme (the threshold debt level was high, and the cost was substantial),",,
they struggled to access credit over the course of the recovery.84,,"Thus, although the adoption of legal"
"frameworks to facilitate ADR can contribute signiﬁcantly to the swift resolution of NPLs, regulators",,
"should push for workout agreements to include commitments that put businesses on a path to viability,",,
lest they merely prolong or defer the underlying economic challenges.,,
Establishing accessible and inexpensive in-court and ,,
out-of-court debt resolution procedures for MSMEs,,
"MSMEs play a critical role in economic growth and employment, particularly in emerging economies,",,
but they have been the enterprises hardest-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. They are more vulnerable,,
than large enterprises to debt distress and less equipped to seek recourse in either the debt market or,,
the legal system. It is therefore not surprising that they have shorter survival times (ﬁgure 3.2).85,,Post–
COVID-19 insolvency reforms should therefore address the speciﬁc needs of MSMEs to facilitate the,,
recapitalization of viable but illiquid ﬁrms and the swift but least painful market exit of nonviable ﬁrms.,,
"This is particularly important in emerging economies, where MSMEs represent a large proportion of",,
total ﬁrms.86 ,,

Why MSME procedures matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The World Bank’s Business Pulse Survey, conducted on a rolling basis of enterprises in 50 countries, has",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"June to September 2020, of the ﬁrms reporting they were in arrears or expecting to be in arrears within ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"six months, 48 percent were MSMEs (including 53 percent of microenterprises within that group),",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(including 84 percent of microenterprises within that group) reported lower monthly sales than in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"previous year, compared with 73 percent of large enterprises (ﬁgure 3.4).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most insolvency frameworks subject MSMEs and large companies to the same rules and processes.87 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tail: rates remained above 10 percent until 2005, and only 48 percent of NPLs in Thailand were resolved",,,

Reforms to facilitate MSME insolvency proceedings,,,
"As noted earlier, in 2017 the World Bank published a comprehensive review of MSMEs and insolvency",,,
"frameworks, setting out the characteristics and requirements.94 The 2021 “Principles for Eﬀective Insol-",,,
vency and Creditor/Debtor Regimes” and an updated version of the UNCITRAL “Legislative Guide on,,,
Insolvency Law” (see online annex 3E) together provide a series of principles and recommendations on,,,
"insolvency frameworks aimed at assisting MSMEs with insolvency. Drawing on those sources, table 3.1",,,
sets out some priority areas of reform in the context of COVID-19 recovery. It is important to note that,,,
the World Bank’s “Principles” and UNCITRAL’s “Guide” include signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in how a MSME,,,
insolvency framework can be achieved.,,,
"Even before the onset of the pandemic, some jurisdictions implemented reforms tailored to MSMEs.",,,
"For example, in February 2020 Myanmar implemented a MSME-speciﬁc insolvency regime that included",,,
"a business rescue framework under a debtor-in-possession model. In the United States, the 2019 Small",,,
Business Reorganization Act introduced a distinct insolvency framework for small enterprises. Mean-,,,
"while, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic’s December 2019 Enterprise Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy",,,
Law contains provisions for small enterprises.95 ,,,
The COVID-19 crisis spurred other jurisdictions to follow suit with temporary reforms. For exam-,,,
"ple, Colombia introduced a temporary fast-track restructuring framework administered by the Chamber",,,
of Commerce for MSMEs.96,"Similarly, in December 2020 Singapore introduced a temporary Simpliﬁed",,
Insolvency Program that lowers the proportion of creditors required to approve an MSME insolvency,,,
"plan,97 which expired on July 28, 2021.98 The United States temporarily raised the debt threshold for busi-",,,
ness restructuring (thereby increasing the accessibility of more heavily indebted businesses to restructur-,,,

"2021, but were extended to 2022.99 Addressing obstacles to creditor recovery, New Zealand introduced the",,,
"COVID-19 Response Legislation Act 2020, which put in place a business debt hibernation scheme,100 and",,,
"Spain extended the duty of administrators to request the declaration of bankruptcy, while also increasing",,,
the standard of the liquidity test.101 ,,,
Other jurisdictions have implemented longer-term reforms in response to COVID-19. These reforms,,,
are aimed at simplifying and demystifying the bankruptcy process for small businesses. In terms of,,,
"simpliﬁcation, legislation pending in Chile will streamline liquidation and reorganization proceedings",,,
for small businesses.102,"And in January 2021, the United Kingdom introduced a simpliﬁed process for",,

debtors,,,
"This section addresses the bankruptcy of natural person debtors—that is, individual entrepreneurs or",,,
just individual debtors. Because the pandemic has devastated many people’s livelihoods through no fault,,,
"of their own, debt forgiveness and discharge, as well as reputational protections, are critical tools in the",,,
"COVID-19 recovery. The law and the courts should aim to quickly resolve no-income, no-asset cases and",,,
provide a discharge and fresh start for all natural person debtors.,,,
"Despite the potential beneﬁts of personal bankruptcy frameworks, a signiﬁcant proportion of emerg-",,,
"ing economies have none. In 2011, a World Bank survey of 25 advanced and 33 emerging economies",,,
found that 48 percent of emerging economies lacked a legal framework for the discharge or cancellation,,,
"of an insolvent individual’s debt, compared with 12 percent of advanced economies. Of the emerging",,,
"economies, 51 percent lacked a legal framework for the restructuring of individual debt obligations,",,,
compared with 20 percent of advanced economies.104 ,,,
Personal bankruptcy frameworks can beneﬁt individual debtors both in their capacity as consum-,,,
ers and producers and in their ownership of unincorporated businesses because there is no legal sepa-,,,
"ration between owners and their businesses. Personal bankruptcy laws, and particularly a pathway to",,,
"discharge, are important for MSMEs, which are often ﬁnanced at least in part by debt that has been per-",,,
sonally guaranteed by the entrepreneur.105,Comparable global data are limited on the share of personal,,
"bankruptcies resulting from business debt, partly because of the diﬀerent ways in which business debt",,,
"and nonbusiness debt are classiﬁed. However, statistics published by the Australian personal insolvency",,,
regulator suggest that between July 2019 and October 2021 about one in four personal bankruptcies was,,,
"of a sole trader, partner in a partnership, or company officer.106 ",,,
Personal bankruptcy laws provide an orderly framework for repaying or discharging the debts of,,,
individual debtors. This framework is especially helpful in periods of high levels of personal insolvency,,,
because the lack of a credible alternative to recover a debt often drives creditors to pursue piecemeal,,,
approaches. Those approaches can result in the unnecessary destruction of value stemming from court,,,
"ﬁling fees, enforcement costs, and the lost opportunity costs of a negotiated pathway to solvency and",,,
repayment.107,"Piecemeal approaches also clog the courts and impose avoidable hardships on debtors,",,
including the loss of domicile and the stigma of ongoing debt collection.,,,
Reforms of personal bankruptcy frameworks in response to COVID-19 have been minimal. One,,,
reform includes a framework for bankruptcy for natural persons in China’s Shenzhen Special Economic,,,
"Zone. The ﬁrst of its kind in China, the framework provides for a three-year probationary period during",,,
which the bankrupt person’s spending is subject to supervision before debts are discharged.108,Tempo-,,
rary reforms enacted in Australia increase the threshold for the value of debts outstanding required to,,,
commence bankruptcy proceedings and facilitate the use of personal insolvency agreements for debt,,,
resolution.109,,,
"In addition to personal insolvency reforms, many countries have reformed their legal frameworks",,,
for dealing with the insolvency of MSMEs. To the extent that these reforms also apply to the owners,,,
"of unincorporated businesses and address their personal liability for business debt, they fall into the",,,
category of personal insolvency reforms because they provide a pathway out of overindebtedness for,,,
"individuals, including through discharge.110",,,
,RESTRUCTURING FIRM AND HOUSEHOLD DEBT,|,141
A principal purpose of a personal insolvency regime is to rehabilitate insolvent debtors and restore,,,,,,,,,,,,
their economic capacity.111 In circumstances in which there is no prospect of repayment (or the societal,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cost of enforcing repayment outweighs the value of the repayment), there is no beneﬁt to enforcement",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for creditors. However, the extent to which policy makers can and will allow debt forgiveness is a politi-",,,,,,,,,,,,
cal decision and will depend on the context.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excessive ﬁling costs can deter debtors from ﬁling for personal insolvency.112 These obstacles should be,,,,,,,,,,,,
removed for low-income and asset debtors. Examples of jurisdictions with frameworks to alleviate ﬁling,,,,,,,,,,,,
"costs for low-income and asset debtors are Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United Kingdom (and",,,,,,,,,,,,
Wales).113,,Regimes can target these procedures at those who are genuinely unable to meet their obliga-,,,,,,,,,,
tions. Digitalization also holds some promise as a means of lowering costs and increasing accessibility. In,,,,,,,,,,,,
"October 2020, Australia introduced a digital bankruptcy application process for personal bankruptcy.114",,,,,,,,,,,,
Another avenue for the protection of individual debtors is credit reporting frameworks. Many juris-,,,,,,,,,,,,
dictions responded to the COVID-19 crisis by temporarily altering credit reporting frameworks to limit,,,,,,,,,,,,
the long-term reputational harm to debtors temporarily unable to meet their debt obligations as a result,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the pandemic. Crises tend to lower the credit scores of aﬀected borrowers. A study of the impact of,,,,,,,,,,,,
natural disasters on the ﬁnancial health of US residents in aﬀected regions found that credit scores,,,,,,,,,,,,
declined by as much as 22 points.115 ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forbearance programs to temporarily pause or reduce installments for a limited time were used in,,,,,,,,,,,,
the COVID-19 pandemic by 57 percent of the 65 countries surveyed by the International Committee on,,,,,,,,,,,,
Credit Reporting.116 During the forbearance period—often three or six months and in some places up to,,,,,,,,,,,,
a year—accounts were “frozen/paused” so that clients were reported as current even if payments were,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reduced or suspended. To reﬂect the forbearance programs, credit reporting bureaus implemented or",,,,,,,,,,,,
used existing special reporting codes to ﬂag the type of facilities aﬀected by COVID-19.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the United States, the CARES Act provided for 180 days of forbearance for federally backed loans,",,,,,,,,,,,,
and,credit,providers,were,encouraged,to,consider,their,own,programs,for,similar,modiﬁcation.117 
The main credit reporting agencies adjusted their algorithms to ensure that accounts aﬀected by the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"COVID-19 pandemic were not negatively impacted. Kenya, Malaysia, and Greece took a more direct",,,,,,,,,,,,
"approach by barring the submission of negative credit data for a period of six months, nine months, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"the pandemic period, respectively. During the prescribed period, credit bureaus did not include delin-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"quency data on the credit report and scores. Four countries—Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tanzania—did not implement any speciﬁc measures to protect borrowers, which was largely consistent ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"with the health policy positions of these countries during the pandemic. In the absence of any relief,",,,,,,,,,,,,
delinquencies aﬀected the borrowers’ credit report and score in the ordinary manner.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Policies suspending adverse reporting on borrowers during a grace period should be phased out with,,,,,,,,,,,,
an eye toward maintaining the integrity of the credit reporting system. In the absence of complete infor-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mation, credit providers lack a full view of borrowers, and they may adopt a cautious lending approach",,,,,,,,,,,,
that is counterproductive to the recovery. Suppression of data also introduces operational challenges. In,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the absence of data, TransUnion estimates that when full ﬁle information reporting resumed in Kenya,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"12 percent of borrowers shifted to a high-risk score, reﬂecting increasing delinquencies.118",,,,,,,,,,,,"In addition,"
banks’ requests for credit bureau reports declined from 3.1 million a month in March 2020 to a low of ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.6 million in June 2020, but recovered to 3.6 million in December 2020.119",,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusion,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Debt is critical to prosperity and progress, but the complexity of the problems that arise when debtors",,,,,,,,,,,,
cannot meet their obligations requires sophisticated legal and institutional frameworks. This is true,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction,,
Previous chapters focused on the actions countries can take to reduce damage to the ﬁnancial sector ,,
"if long-term, widespread income losses stemming from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic force ",,
"borrowers to default on their debt. For the economy, however, the risks associated with past loans are not",,
the only concern. A separate challenge is the ability of ﬁnancial service providers to continue extending,,
credit to fuel the recovery. As countries embark on the road to recovery and policy makers wind down,,
the exceptional ﬁscal and other policy support measures put in place to help the economy through the,,
"pandemic, it is paramount that businesses and households have adequate access to credit to withstand",,
"economic uncertainty, invest in opportunities, and take part in the recovery.",,
"The onset of the pandemic extensively disrupted economies worldwide. Lockdowns, business inter-",,
"ruptions and closures, and job losses in the real sector (the activities associated with goods and services)",,
were reﬂected almost immediately in the ﬁnancial sector by a tightening of lending conditions. Bank,,
supervisors and lenders worried that the crisis would rapidly translate into loan losses and cash with-,,
drawals by the public.,,
"As discussed in chapter 1, unprecedented government intervention and regulatory forbearance to",,
mitigate the impacts of the crisis have so far helped banks maintain capital levels and liquidity. Yet the,,
"ongoing impacts of the crisis on business performance and household incomes, as well as the expected",,
"rise in nonperforming loans (NPLs) and tightening of monetary policies, will create challenges for new",,
"lending. Continued economic disruptions and uncertainty will increase credit risk, reduce visibility into",,
"borrower viability, and diminish the realizable value of traditional sources of recourse in the event of",,
default. Reporting practices around loan moratoria and debt restructuring further cloud visibility into,,
the actual credit performance of certain customers.,,
"In this environment of heightened risk and continued uncertainty, ﬁnance providers need to adapt",,
credit models and product oﬀerings if they are to continue lending. Ways of doing this include making,,
changes in product design—the terms and lengths (tenors) of loans—as well as integrating new types of,,
data into credit models. These adaptations will beneﬁt from the continuing adoption of new technol-,,
"ogies and digital channels supporting payments, credit information, and secured transactions. A silver",,
"lining of the pandemic is that it accelerated digital adoption in the economy as a whole, as well as among",,
"ﬁnance providers and borrowers, thereby laying the foundation for better credit analysis and monitor-",,
"ing, greater product diversity, and a broader range of credit providers.",,
"Financial service providers, infrastructure providers, governments, and the regulatory community",,
can all help advance the adoption of solutions to facilitate access to credit during the recovery. This,,
chapter describes approaches available to ﬁnance providers for adjusting their operations and products,,
"to continue lending. It also describes the role of governments, regulators, and ﬁnancial infrastructure in",,
helping the credit market adapt to the new environment—such as by integrating new data and business,,
models—and in countering market tendencies to limit credit to larger ﬁrms and better-oﬀborrowers. As,,
"credit conditions improve, markets that have been able to roll out these solutions and restrain a “ﬂight",,
to quality” will be in a better position to tackle long-standing credit gaps and foster ﬁnancial inclusion.,,
Examples in this chapter illustrate how ﬁnancial service providers have delivered credit to under-,,
"served customers and entrepreneurs during the pandemic by mitigating risk through product design,",,
or by integrating new technologies or improved data models for credit underwriting and servicing.,,
"Innovations in channels, products, and processes have enabled the expansion of lending to riskier and",,
previously underserved segments. Although these innovations will be pivotal to achieving additional,,
"visibility and recourse in the pandemic context, even for previously well-served segments, the rollout",,
156,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
"of certain products, business models, and data may not be feasible in all markets. Their adoption will",,
require thoughtful consideration of systemic and institutional factors as well as consumer protection.,,
The borrowers referred to in this chapter include the small and medium businesses that make up the,,
"majority of enterprises providing jobs in most emerging economies,1",as well as households and micro-,
entrepreneurs. These groups ﬁnd it challenging to access formal credit even when the economy is sound,,
"and growing, and all have been signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the pandemic. Nonetheless, the credit needs",,
"of small businesses diﬀer from those of microentrepreneurs, for example, and they are often served by",,
"diﬀerent ﬁnancial services providers, oﬀering diﬀerent solutions.",,
Solving the COVID-19 risk puzzle: Risk visibility and recourse,,
"Beyond its profound impacts on the credit risk of households and businesses, the pandemic signiﬁcantly",,
"impaired the visibility that lenders have into a borrower’s capacity and willingness to repay a loan, and",,
it limited lenders’ options for recourse in the increasingly likely event of a default. Policy responses to,,
"help alleviate the impacts of the pandemic reduced near-term risks, but further reduced visibility into",,
and certainty about the underlying viability of borrowers. The protracted eﬀects of the pandemic on,,
"the economy and the ﬁnancial sector may over time aﬀect the liquidity and capital of ﬁnance providers,",,
diminishing even more their willingness and ability to take on risk.,,
A lender’s decision to extend credit and the associated terms reﬂect the amount of risk the lender is,,
willing to take based on estimates of both the borrower’s probability of default and the anticipated loss,,
in the event of a default. The ability to assess the likelihood of repayment depends on the available infor-,,
"mation about the borrower and the context of the loan (visibility), whereas estimates of loss in case of",,
default are based on the market for collateral or the enforceability of guarantees (recourse).,,
"As noted in earlier chapters, the pandemic and associated lockdowns had a profound impact on eco-",,
"nomic activity, aﬀecting borrowers (businesses and households) directly and increasing credit risk. For",,
"some sectors and businesses, the impact was transitory and it diminished as lockdowns were lifted. For",,
"others, the eﬀects will last longer. For example, in Rwanda business sectors that rely on in-person work",,
(such as construction and accommodation and food) were more aﬀected by the lockdowns than sectors,,
"that could transition some of their activities to remote working. Once lockdowns were lifted, however,",,
"construction quickly recovered well above precrisis levels, but for the accommodation and food sector,",,
"where face-to-face interactions with customers are necessary, the crisis dragged on.2 When lenders con-",,
"front uncertain conditions, they typically respond by tightening credit standards and reducing credit",,
"supply, shifting to safer assets. If lenders lack solid information with which to assess risks, they reduce",,
"credit not only to insolvent businesses and households, but also to everyone else because they are not",,
able to distinguish between the two groups.,,
"Although uncertainty has always been part of lender business models, before the pandemic ﬁnance",,
providers were better able to determine a borrower’s ability and willingness to repay and the probability,,
"of default by taking into account credit and payment histories, income, or assets; nonﬁnancial infor-",,
"mation (such as home address, relevant sector of the borrower’s business, and length of banking rela-",,
tionship) that can act as a proxy for income; the purpose of the loan (home loans or loans for business,,
equipment have a diﬀerent risk proﬁle than loans for consumption or working capital); and the time,,
"horizon for the loan (visibility tends to be higher over shorter time horizons). For business loans, lenders",,
would rely on heuristics and models to take into account sector or demographic norms (such as typical,,
inventory turns or balance sheet ratios for a given industry).,,
"The signiﬁcant structural break caused by the crisis diminished, however, the value of past data",,
"and heuristics. Traditional credit data sources are largely backward-looking. But with so many sectors,",,
LENDING DURING THE RECOVERY AND BEYOND,|,157
"businesses, and individual incomes disrupted, past performance is no longer as strong an indicator",,
of future performance. Typical reporting delays by lenders and infrequent updates of credit registries,,
and credit bureau data are a challenge in the rapidly evolving pandemic. Even for sectors that might be,,
"expected to recover, lenders might not have the timely relevant information needed to accurately deter-",,
mine whether an existing or prospective borrower would still have the income and ability to navigate the,,
new economic environment.,,
Even the more qualitative relationship-based methods that lenders typically use to smooth lending,,
over an economic cycle were compromised. Loan officer visits were limited or delayed by lockdowns and,,
social distancing.3,,"Lenders had difficulty meeting new clients, verifying customer identity, and evalu-"
"ating a borrower’s business operations on site, and they curtailed the in-person collections and group",,
meetings central to many microﬁnance business models. These and other operational challenges were,,
particularly acute earlier in the crisis. Many of these challenges have since been overcome through the,,
"use of digital tools, but operational constraints continue to be a factor in many markets.",,
"The unprecedented level of policy interventions—including government transfers, debt moratoria,",,
"loan reschedulings, and suspension of NPL classiﬁcations—further clouded lender visibility by reducing",,
the usefulness of ﬁnancial data and credit information as predictors of a borrower’s ability to repay.,,
Lenders must be able to distinguish whether a borrower’s business is sustainably recovering due to,,
sound fundamentals or is dependent on government support of the business or its customers. Even rela-,,
tively recent data can be misleading.4 Positive cash ﬂows or increases in account balances resulting from,,
government support programs do not indicate longer-term viability. Eventual winding down of that,,
support could later aﬀect ability to repay.,,
"Thus policy interventions that stabilized markets may have, paradoxically, made it more difficult in",,
some cases for lenders to extend the credit needed to resume growth. Along with these challenges around,,
"visibility, the pandemic has also aﬀected the traditional forms of recourse that limit lenders’ losses in the",,
event of default. Having recourse also dissuades borrowers from defaulting in the ﬁrst place. Typical forms,,
"of recourse are collateral and personal guarantees, and both play multiple roles. Lenders use collateral to",,
(1) assess a borrower’s ﬁnancial condition; (2) motivate repayment because a borrower would want to avoid,,
losing the asset; and (3) oﬀset losses in the event of default by seizing and selling the collateral. Personal,,
guarantees signal that the borrower has reputable relationships that the lender can call on to repay a loan,,
in the event the borrower defaults; this is both an indicator of ﬁnancial standing and a loss mitigant in the,,
event of default. Guarantees also formalize an element of social pressure to motivate repayment. Provid-,,
"ing collateral or personal guarantees has long been a challenge for micro-, small, and medium enterprises",,
(MSMEs) and households in emerging economies. Group guarantees as part of microﬁnance lending are,,
an attempt to ﬁll that gap for individual microentrepreneurs. Guarantees from government or develop-,,
"ment ﬁnance institutions are another form of recourse, and these may be made more available to MSMEs",,
"under some programs. Less traditional forms of recourse—such as automatic repayments, liens on future",,
"digital receipts and cash ﬂows, and exclusion from marketplace platforms in case of default on a loan",,
"from the platform—can be incorporated into MSME and consumer lending, particularly in the embedded",,
ﬁnance models discussed later in this chapter. The bankruptcy and resolution frameworks described in,,
previous chapters can inﬂuence how eﬀectively and efficiently lenders can use certain types of recourse.,,
"Recourse options during the pandemic were reduced by moratoria, and the value of traditional forms",,
of collateral was altered. Will a commercial building losing tenants (due to the pandemic) be as valuable,,
"as it was with full occupancy? If many restaurants are going out of business, what is the resale value of a",,
"commercial oven? Beyond the theoretical value of an asset, will a bank be able to realize that value during",,
a period of economic uncertainty? Monetary policy and moratoria temporarily forestalled defaults and,,
"liquidations, supporting asset prices. Implemented over long periods, however, debt moratoria, rent",,
158,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
"holidays, and credit guarantees can have the unintended eﬀects of heightening volatility and further",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eroding collateral asset values. The lifting of moratoria and government support measures could pro-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"voke further post-default liquidations, triggering ﬁre sales of assets.5",,,,,,,,,,,These factors have reduced not,,,,,
"only the degree to which lenders can rely on traditional forms of recourse, but also their ability to project",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the value of that recourse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Reacting to the combined eﬀects of higher credit risk in the economy, low visibility, and reduced",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recourse, lenders have tightened credit standards and reduced the amount of new credit available to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
support the recovery.6 A review of quarterly central bank surveys on credit conditions from both emerg-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tightening credit standards since the onset of the crisis. Figure 4.1 presents the quarterly net change in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a sharp increase in the share of countries whose ﬁnancial service providers tightened credit standards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
compared with the previous quarter. Although the pace of tightening appears to have slowed in 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with lenders across many countries beginning to ease credit conditions, the data suggest that for many",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of the countries surveyed credit standards remain substantially tighter than their prepandemic levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reduced credit in the context of crises is particularly challenging for MSMEs and other segments,,
of the economy such as women and informal entrepreneurs who even before the crisis were viewed by,,
ﬁnancial institutions as riskier and more challenging to serve.7 These businesses tend to be more thinly,,
"capitalized, have fewer assets and little excess liquidity, and be relatively undiversiﬁed in terms of prod-",,
"uct markets and customer base. The systemic, negative, real sector shock of the pandemic interrupted",,
revenue streams of the segments already viewed as riskier.8,,Because of this diﬀerential impact on their
"customer base, specialized lenders, including credit unions, savings banks, microﬁnance institutions",,
"(MFIs), and other nonbank ﬁnancial institutions that focus on MSMEs and underserved households,",,
"faced operational and fundraising challenges that aﬀected their ability to deliver credit. In addition,",,
access to short-term trade ﬁnance was a challenge for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) during the,,
COVID-19 pandemic as costs and application rejection rates increased.9,,The International Chamber of
Commerce reported that banks either retrenched from segments perceived as high risk such as SMEs or,,
hiked prices for short-term trade ﬁnancing for them.10,,
Many lenders lack the capacity to mitigate eﬀectively the new risks introduced by the COVID-19,,
crisis and have responded by limiting credit to all but the lowest-risk borrowers. If ﬁnancial markets,,
"continue this trend, they could unleash a vicious cycle (see ﬁgure 1.2 in chapter 1). In such a cycle, the",,
widespread reduction in credit to MSMEs forces more of them out of business before they can recover,,
"and drive growth, with follow-on impacts on the households whose members are employed by or other-",,
"wise depend on these businesses for income, products, or services.11",,Business failures can have a dom-
"ino eﬀect, with the ﬁrst failures pushing upstream companies out of business because of the reduced",,
"demand for their products or services. Over time, accelerating business failures increase the bad debt",,
"burden on lenders and reduce their capital and capacity to lend, as well as their willingness to take risk.",,
Movement in this direction would cut government tax revenue while at the same time increasing the,,
"need for ﬁscal support for households, ﬁrms, and potentially ﬁnancial institutions in need of bailouts.",,
Markets in which lenders are able to manage and mitigate the risk of new lending to meet the ﬁnanc-,,
ing needs of businesses and households despite the heightened uncertainty could unleash a virtuous,,
"cycle, supporting the eﬀorts of small and large businesses and households to restart spending and to",,
"invest in the economic recovery. For example, a small shop may be solvent and viable but need addi-",,
tional working capital to replace spoiled inventory and cover costs until retail activity recovers. Or a,,
manufacturer may need to invest in raw materials and production well before it receives income from,,
"sales. For households, credit could help them maintain consumption—such as paying fees for school or",,
"childcare—or meet ﬁnancial emergencies before their income has fully recovered, with beneﬁts for the",,
broader economy through spending. Improved prospects for businesses and households have a positive,,
"impact on the income and capital of the lenders serving them, further increasing lenders’ capacity to",,
lend and their risk appetite.,,
Regulators have a central role in supporting a virtuous cycle by encouraging the ﬁnancial sector’s,,
eﬀorts to adapt while monitoring ﬁnancial stability. Recovery of economic activity and spending can,,
raise tax revenue and allow governments to shift their focus from broad-based ﬁscal support programs,,
to targeted ones to support those parts of the economy hardest-hit by the crisis and to lower the risk,,
"associated with longer-term investments to support job creation and a sustainable recovery. Finally, as",,
"economic conditions stabilize in the recovery, lenders that have successfully adapted to the “new nor-",,
mal” may become better able to extend longer-term ﬁnancing to support capital investments by MSMEs,,
and to reach low-income households and informal businesses previously excluded by the ﬁnancial sec-,,
"tor, thereby further reducing the need for government intervention.",,
"To prevent onset of the vicious cycle and unleash a virtuous one, lenders will have to embrace tools",,
that allow them to overcome the visibility and recourse challenges aﬀecting their ability to measure and,,
manage risk.,,

Improving risk mitigation,,,,
This section highlights strategies that lenders can adopt to manage or mitigate risk so they can provide,,,,
ﬁnancially viable borrowers with credit in an environment of heightened risk and uncertainty. Digital-,,,,
"ization, which accelerated during the pandemic, can facilitate the feasibility and adoption of many of",,,,
these strategies.,,,,
"To continue to lend through the pandemic and the recovery, ﬁnance providers need new approaches",,,,
"to measuring risk, as well as new approaches to product design, both of which can improve visibility and",,,,
strengthen recourse in order to balance risk. Lenders can start by reassessing their existing sector and,,,,
borrower scoring models and updating them where possible based on information on economic activity,,,,
"by sector or geography. Most lenders have by now recognized that there has been a structural break, and",,,,
both business models and ﬁnancial models need to be retuned. Supervisors can help ensure this is done,,,,
in a timely fashion and that any approvals needed to adapt underwriting and collection procedures or,,,,
deploy updates of risk models are expedited.,,,,
Some banks have assessed the impact of lockdowns by characterizing the risk for each industry- ,,,,
geography intersection.12,Banco Pichincha in Ecuador personalized repayment terms and adapted its,,,
"ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial services to support borrowers and continue lending, while Konfío in Mexico",,,,
took time to adapt its credit algorithms before resuming its growth. 4G Capital in Kenya piloted mobile,,,,
surveys to seek to incorporate a measure of borrower ﬁnancial stress in its credit underwriting.13 Lend-,,,,

"and incorporate risk-sharing facilities where available. These approaches, and their potential impacts on",,,,

Policy makers can also help by establishing the infrastructure and regulatory environment needed to,,,
support new approaches to visibility and recourse and to encourage innovation and the growth of new,,,
"players with diverse business models and risk appetites. For riskier sectors and segments, governments",,,
"may also have to continue deploying risk mitigation instruments, such as well-calibrated credit guar-",,,
"antees, to support access to ﬁnance. Targeted liquidity or income support schemes may continue to be",,,
required for those in need for whom borrowing is not appropriate.,,,
Alternative data,,,
"Although the pandemic reduced lenders’ visibility into credit risk, they are not without options. Alter-",,,
native data sources can inform risk assessments and allow lenders to ﬁll pandemic-related information,,,
"gaps. As risk and uncertainty decline, these approaches can also be used to extend credit to underserved",,,
segments that were informationally opaque even before the pandemic.,,,
The term,,alternative data,"refers to information not included in traditional credit reports, which"
"focus on outstanding loans and repayment history. For example, a wide range of transactional data",,,
"are available from ﬁnancial service providers, mobile network operators and other utilities, traditional",,,
"businesses and online platforms, and governments. These data include bank deposits and withdraw-",,,
"als, mobile money use, airtime top-ups and utilities payments, payroll, rent, taxes, supply orders and",,,
"deliveries, sales orders, invoices, and business receipts. Nonﬁnancial data from social media footprints,",,,
"psychometrics, online behavior, and telecommunications usage, including top-up and calling patterns,",,,
"contacts, and global positioning system (GPS) data, can supplement transactional data.14",,These data,
have been found to provide information that is at least as predictive as that held by credit bureaus. Many,,,
"of these data are considered “big data”—that is, data produced by digital channels and characterized by",,,
"high volume, variety, and velocity.15",,,
One study found that in Germany credit scoring models based on digital footprints were better at pre-,,,
dicting creditworthiness than credit bureau scores. The two assessments can complement each other for,,,
greater sensitivity.16,,A study of loan data from a large ﬁntech lender in India showed that use of mobile,
and social footprints can improve risk assessments for individuals with credit scores and be an eﬀective,,,
indicator for individuals who lack credit bureau records.17,,Research from South America found similar,
results from the use of call data records to predict credit repayment outcomes for individuals lacking a,,,
credit history.18,,"Meanwhile, a US study found that transaction data can be used to create risk proﬁles",
capable of serving individuals otherwise excluded or charged higher interest rates.19,,"Finally, research",
from China found that the use of big data to assess the probability of default led to increased credit,,,
access for borrowers who otherwise would have remained unbanked or who would have been required,,,
to pledge collateral to access ﬁnancing.20,,,
Alternative data can also help lenders to update sector and business assessments (see box 4.1). Because,,,
"some industries have been more (and some less) directly aﬀected by the pandemic, standard market",,,
reports are no longer as accurate. Retuning existing models is an important ﬁrst step to improving risk,,,
"assessments, although the scale and depth of the crisis will likely continue to require lenders to update",,,
or reset benchmarking data over time.,,,
"Despite the opportunity presented by the growing abundance of alternative and big data, several",,,
"challenges are posed by issues of availability, validation, and interpretation in underwriting. Availability",,,
is aﬀected by a prospective borrower’s use of the services and platforms that generate and hold alter-,,,
"native data. These platforms are often owned and controlled by private third parties, and so lenders",,,
"must secure access to the data. For example, although a bank may have payment transaction data, the",,,
"mobile operator collects call records, and the electric company has utility billing and payment records. ",,,
162,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,
"Lenders may collect some data directly from the borrower’s phone, which raises privacy concerns about,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for example, other people’s data that may reside in the borrower’s contacts list and text message records.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some prospective borrowers may have documents such as bills or payment records containing these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"data, but these can be hard to assemble and validate. In some markets, credit registries and bureaus,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as well as new ﬁntech data companies, are beginning to collect and validate this information (see box",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.8 later in this chapter). Data privacy and open banking frameworks are increasingly seeking to vest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ownership and control of data in data subjects,21",,,,,,,enabling those subjects to grant permission to third,,,,,,,,
parties—including lenders—to access their data. The 2021,,,,,,,,,World Development Report,,,discusses issues,,,
related to accessibility and intellectual property of this type of private intent data.22 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"is steadily increasing, yet an industry survey estimated that, going into the pandemic, just 25 percent",,,
of ﬁnancial sector ﬁrms relied on ML to detect fraud or support underwriting and risk management.29 ,,,
"Increasingly, software-as-a-service solutions as well as integrations with specialized technology allow",,,

Alternative lenders with operating models designed to leverage technology for process automation,,,
and to incorporate alternative data in credit underwriting grew rapidly in the years prior to the pan-,,,
demic. COVID-19 demonstrated that these lenders could also withstand a major shock.31,The business,,
"models of alternative lenders vary widely, as do the size and economic status of the borrowers they tar-",,,
get. The range of business models includes crowdfunding and marketplace platforms; mobile phone,,,
"lenders that access transaction and mobile phone data; lending to MSMEs based on invoices, payment",,,
"ﬂows, or order information from suppliers; and personal loans based on regular salary or remittance",,,
income.32 Many of these business models target formalized small businesses and middle-income to afflu-,,,
"ent individuals. However, some alternative lending models speciﬁcally focus on microloans and micro-",,,
leases to individuals or working capital for informal businesses and MSMEs. Although it is too early to,,,
conclude that during the pandemic alternative lenders as a whole demonstrated greater resilience than,,,
"traditional ﬁnancial services providers, the case studies in this chapter on Konfío (box 4.1) and MYbank",,,
(box 4.6) show that these models can adapt to a new normal for a tier of borrowers that otherwise would,,,
ﬁnd it difficult to access credit.,,,
Scaling up the use of alternative data and AI to enable equitable access to ﬁnance during the pandemic,,,
"recovery will require investments not just by alternative, digital-ﬁrst lenders, but also by traditional",,,
"banks and other ﬁnancial service providers, including those that serve lower-income households and",,,
"microenterprises. Meanwhile, alternative ﬁnance businesses serve too few customers relative to the scale",,,
"of ﬁnance likely to be needed to drive the recovery in most markets. More speciﬁcally, alternative ﬁnance",,,
providers represent less than 1 percent of credit ﬂows worldwide. Lending by ﬁntech and technology,,,
"companies in 2019 was estimated to be 5.8 percent of the stock of credit in Kenya, 2 percent in China,",,,
"1.1 percent in Indonesia, and less than 1 percent of overall credit to the private sector in other major",,,
markets.33,"Incumbent ﬁnancial institutions, by contrast, have the capital, size, and client relationships",,
to supply credit to drive a broader recovery in their economies. It will be imperative that they overcome,,,
any cultural and capacity constraints and regulatory frictions that limit their ability to innovate to both,,,
support the recovery from the pandemic and compete longer term with new technology-driven lenders. ,,,
Two areas needing attention in the near term to ensure that innovations in the use of data and ana-,,,

A signiﬁcant risk from which consumers need protection is cybercrime. Surveys of users of digital,,,

fraud or attempted fraud when using a ﬁnancial service since the onset of COVID-19.35,"Meanwhile,",,

Consumer protection guidelines must also ensure that digital ﬁnancial service providers deliver prod-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ucts appropriate for a given customer. Financial literacy levels among households and MSMEs remain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"low.38 The proliferation of digital ﬁnance has outpaced the ﬁnancial literacy of many consumers, as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

used for predatory pricing. Although the price discrimination enabled by AI-powered models is a form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of economic efficiency, it can lead to unfair outcomes for riskier or less ﬁnancially literate borrowers.40",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Digital technologies can play a role in helping to address this challenge. Consumer advocates can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use technology channels to deliver simple, actionable, accessible, and personalized ﬁnancial education,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially to youth. Many governments delivered ﬁnancial education messages through digital chan-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nels during the pandemic. Innovations such as personalized ﬁnancial counseling and behavioral nudges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
related to ﬁnancial goals can also strengthen ﬁnancial consumer protection.41,,,,,,,,,,"Technology, and social",,,,,
"media in particular, can also be used to achieve a more robust redress mechanism for consumers.42 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although digital delivery of ﬁnancial education promotes ﬁnancial resilience in several ways, it requires",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basic digital skills and access to information infrastructure (such as a smartphone and broadband/ ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mortgage has diﬀerent terms and longer tenor than an unsecured loan because recourse to the property,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Short-term ﬁnancing is not appropriate for all borrowers. For example, a short-term loan, even with",,,,,,,,,,,,
"rollovers, may not be suitable for long-term projects or capital investments. Short-duration credit terms",,,,,,,,,,,,
"can, however, help lenders improve visibility on certain informationally opaque borrowers and open the",,,,,,,,,,,,
door to subsequent longer-term ﬁnancing.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Secured credit,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another approach to mitigating risk is through product conﬁgurations that improve recourse. Tradi-,,,,,,,,,,,,
tional recourse options are limited for many borrowers in emerging economies because real estate is,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the preferred collateral for most banks, and many small ﬁrms and individuals do not own property.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, loan applications from small ﬁrms are frequently rejected for lack of collateral, accord- ",,,,,,,,,,,,
ing to World Bank Enterprise Surveys data.47,,,,,Because the pandemic introduced uncertainty around,,,,,,,
"the value of collateral, ﬁnancial institutions increased collateral requirements, making it harder ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"to obtain ﬁnancing, even for those who do have qualifying assets. In quarterly surveys of credit",,,,,,,,,,,,
"conditions in Mexico, for example, ﬁrms reported a progressive increase in bank collateral require-",,,,,,,,,,,,
"ments through June 2021.48 Other forms of recourse more common for lower-income borrowers, ",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,LENDING DURING THE RECOVERY AND BEYOND,,,,,,|,175
such as personal guarantees and the reputational sanctions characteristic of group microﬁnance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lending models, may also have been aﬀected by the pandemic. For example, social distancing pre-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vented group meetings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Widening the range of assets accepted as collateral could enable lenders to ﬁnd eﬀective means of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recourse where hard collateral is not available, allowing them to better manage the risk of extending",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
credit through the pandemic and the recovery. Movable assets account for roughly 78 percent of enter-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"prise capital stock in emerging economies, and yet many lack modern, secured transaction regimes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would permit the use of movable assets as collateral.49 The modernization of legal frameworks for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
secured transactions and the introduction of movable asset collateral registries create new options to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mitigate credit risk. Technology, including digital ledgers, can be implemented to facilitate the design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and implementation of collateral registries, as well as for the creation and transfer of digital assets to be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used as collateral.50 A study found that collateral registries for movable assets eﬀectively address infor-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mation asymmetries and foster access to ﬁnance. In countries that introduced registries, the number of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ﬁrms with access to ﬁnance increased by an average of 10 percentage points, interest rates declined, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tenors lengthened, with stronger impacts on smaller and younger ﬁrms.51 ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asset-based lending can thus reduce the risk of default and create the conditions for lenders to pro-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vide larger loans and serve borrowers with no previous credit history. A study in Kenya found that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"farmers who were oﬀered an asset-backed, small down payment loan to purchase water tanks were",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much more likely to make the investment than farmers oﬀered a standard collateralized loan—and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
repayment rates were comparable.52 Another study in Pakistan found that hire purchase agreements—a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
type of leasing contract—motivated an MFI to ﬁnance business assets worth several times its prevail-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ing borrowing limit, while maintaining low default rates and oﬀering ﬂexible repayment options. The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asset-based ﬁnance contracts had signiﬁcant and persistent eﬀects on the resilience and growth of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"microenterprises, as well as on corresponding household wealth, compared with the MFI’s traditional",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loan products.53 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another type of asset-based, ﬂexible leasing contract known as pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) had been",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"emerging as an eﬀective product for small asset ﬁnancing prior to the pandemic, and it has shown resil-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ience through the crisis. The product was originally developed to enable households to ﬁnance solar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"home systems, but it has also been used for the purchase of two-wheel transport and appliances.54 Some",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"PAYGo providers incorporate innovative forms of recourse, such as a remote “lockout” that makes the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supply chain finance,,,
Supply chain ﬁnance shares many of the features of embedded ﬁnance in terms of its ability to mitigate,,,
risk by linking credit to a commercial interaction. By tying short-term credit exposures to the movement,,,
"of goods or inventories in the context of an established relationship between supply chain participants,",,,
supply chain ﬁnance improves visibility into the borrower’s probability of default.62,Even though credit,,
"in a supply chain transaction is typically unsecured, lenders gain recourse from the fact that trans-",,,
actions take place within a network that includes anchor buyers or distributors on whom the borrower,,,
"depends for business. These relationships within a supply chain mitigate risk, improve efficiency, and",,,
lower the cost of providing ﬁnance.,,,
"Larger corporate buyers or distributors often provide their value chains with ﬁnancing. For example,",,,
"buyers may decide to pay their suppliers faster to support their working capital and operations, or sellers",,,
and distributors may allow downstream MSMEs to pay later or in installments. This form of supply,,,
chain ﬁnance depends on the liquidity of these corporate anchors and their willingness to take on the,,,
risk of providing—and typically subsidizing—credit to ensure the viability of their value chains. As the,,,
"pandemic broke out, many corporate anchors sought to support the liquidity of their suppliers and dis-",,,
"tributors.63 For example, 10 global fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) manufacturers increased their",,,
"own use of working capital during the ﬁrst half of 2020, largely to support their commercial counter-",,,
parties. 64,"To protect the liquidity of their distributors, seven of the 10 FMCGs manufacturers on-lent",,
working capital by extending receivable payment terms. The same corporate anchors reduced accounts,,,
"payable by around 10 percent, thereby channeling working capital to suppliers. The anchors increased",,,
their outstanding debt by 13 percent (approximately $45 billion) from the end of 2019 to the second,,,
"quarter of 2020, eﬀectively intermediating between the capital markets and their value chains to take",,,
on credit risk that banks or other lenders may not have been willing to assume.,,,
Not all anchors are willing or able to take on the balance sheet volumes and risks involved in extending,,,
ﬁnancing to their suppliers and distributors. Supply chain ﬁnance programs that involve a third-party,,,
ﬁnancial institution (such as factoring or reverse factoring programs) can be very eﬀective in reducing,,,
risk and supporting access to ﬁnance for suppliers.65,Lenders in these programs—embedded between a,,
"corporate buyer and its suppliers, often SMEs—use invoice data to gain visibility into the future cash",,,
"ﬂows of the borrowing suppliers. In some programs, the lender may have additional recourse to the",,,
"buyer that established the program. Hepsiburada, a Turkish e-commerce platform, facilitates ﬁnancing",,,
for merchants and suppliers both directly and by enabling bank lending through an internal platform,,,
that submits a supplier’s or merchant’s invoices to the lending bank as evidence of receivables.66 Supply,,,

Insuring credit risk and catalyzing long-term investments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This chapter has highlighted examples of lenders adopting innovative and often tech-enabled approaches,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to improving visibility and recourse so they can continue and even increase lending. Achieving the right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mix of risk management approaches is challenging in a high-risk and rapidly changing context. For that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reason, credit guarantees (CGs) have been, and will continue to be, a useful tool for motivating lenders",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to continue oﬀering credit during high-risk periods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By having recourse to a guarantor when a borrower defaults, lenders are able to signiﬁcantly reduce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their losses. Guarantors are often government agencies or public institutions, but mutual guarantee",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
182,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,
"systems are available in some markets, especially in Europe. Private trade credit insurance also plays an",,,
important role in global markets and particularly trade ﬁnance. Public development banks and develop-,,,
"ment ﬁnance institutions also play an important role in promoting lending to MSMEs, other productive",,,
"sectors, and areas of policy priority.71 ",,,
Credit guarantee schemes have been a central pandemic response by governments in advanced,,,
"and several emerging economies. In 2020, public credit guarantee schemes amounted to an estimated ",,,
2 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP).72,Evidence from some countries such as Spain that,,
embraced CGs during the COVID-19 crisis indicates that CGs have improved MSMEs’ access to ﬁnance,,,
and have imposed a smaller ﬁscal burden relative to government-backed grants or direct lending.73 ,,,
A recent study of the impact of COVID-19 on SME failures estimates that loans backed by govern- ,,,
ment guarantees can be more eﬀective and efficient than cash grants for limiting bankruptcy rates and,,,
returning trends to precrisis levels.74,"Furthermore, guarantees played a crucial role in supporting the",,
access of SMEs to trade ﬁnance products. A survey of member countries of the Organisation for Eco-,,,
nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that commercial banks and trade credit insurance,,,
"providers displayed a diminished appetite for risk, while government-supported export credit agencies",,,
saw a signiﬁcant increase in applications and volume.75 ,,,
"As economies reduce the use of broad ﬁscal and monetary support measures, guarantors may have to",,,
continue supporting lenders where credit risk remains high and visibility and recourse remain limited.,,,
"Because CGs play a role in balancing the risk equation for lenders even during normal times, they could",,,
"be among the last ﬁscal measures to be reduced or withdrawn, possibly playing an even bigger role than",,,
before the crisis. In addition to reducing the risk of ﬁnancing MSMEs and sectors especially aﬀected by,,,
"the crisis, guarantee programs can be adjusted to reduce lenders’ risk of providing longer-term ﬁnanc-",,,
ing to support investments by businesses in adapting to their new economic reality as well as to de-risk,,,
"ﬁnancing to emerging areas and sectors with the potential to support a sustainable, inclusive recovery.",,,
"In the transition from pandemic response to economic recovery, guarantors should, however, adjust",,,
CG program parameters gradually and in sync with the unwinding of ﬁscal support measures. Many of,,,
these adjustments may require tightening the program design to ensure that only ﬁrms that are well run,,,
yet need support beneﬁt from guarantees.76,"Like cash grants and loans by state-owned banks, CGs can",,
"potentially misallocate resources to weak “zombie ﬁrms,” or to strong ﬁrms that do not need the CG to",,,
survive. A recent analysis concludes that the more common resource misallocation is use of guarantees,,,
for ﬁrms that did not need them (thus tying up limited capital).77 ,,,
Digital technologies can enable the collection and analysis of data to facilitate timely performance,,,
"assessments of CGs and ensure transparent reporting. As the economy recovers, stricter screening",,,
should aim to exclude zombie ﬁrms and reduce the portion of each loan that is guaranteed to motivate,,,
strong underwriting practices by loan originators and maintain program sustainability to reduce the,,,
"ﬁscal burden. To direct resources toward smaller enterprises, governments could lower the size cap for",,,
eligible borrowers. An appropriately priced guarantee premium could help discourage lenders from over-,,,
using guarantees; guarantors should revise pricing as economic conditions improve. (For more on the,,,
"design and execution of eﬀective credit guarantees, see spotlight 4.1.)",,,
"Beyond insuring against credit risk, development banks, as well as regional and international ﬁnan-",,,
"cial institutions, will continue to play an important role in the recovery by providing long-term ﬁnance",,,
and support for capacity development and digital transformation. That role could include catalyzing pri-,,,
"vate lending that can produce positive long-term returns, such as adapting to climate change or shifting",,,
to low-carbon business models. It could also include reaching those underserved parts of the economy,,,
"(such as women and their businesses, minorities, rural areas, and migrants) at risk of being excluded",,,

"nonﬁnancial services oﬀerings to continue growing its portfolio. Between March 2020 and August 2021,",,

Policies to enable access to credit and address risks,,
Approaches to restoring credit growth involve adapting or innovating ways in which ﬁnance providers,,
manage risk. Product features and existing approaches to risk modeling can be adapted to the pandemic,,
"economy, while other measures to improve visibility and recourse may depend on digital channels and",,
tools. Many of the solutions supporting new lending in this context will be technology-driven. Policy,,
makers should therefore consider taking measures to facilitate such innovations in business models,,
"and products, including by supporting the participation of new types of credit providers in the market",,
and by enabling use of new types of data and analytics. Upgrades in ﬁnancial infrastructure can further,,
"foster access to ﬁnance and support resilience in credit markets. However, ﬁnancial innovation may also ",,
"pose new risks to businesses and consumers, as well as to ﬁnancial stability and integrity (see online",,
"annex 4A80). Addressing these risks requires adequate oversight by regulators. In fact, in many countries",,
legacy ﬁnancial sector regulatory and supervisory frameworks and approaches need to be updated.81 ,,
This section reviews some of the policies that may help foster innovation and access to credit while ,,
minimizing risks to consumers and the ﬁnancial sector.,,
"Facilitating innovation through new providers, products, and uses of",,
data and analytics,,
"The digital transformation of ﬁnance is enabling the atomization of services, the recombination of value",,
"chains, and the participation of nontraditional providers.82",,These advances can contribute to greater
"efficiency, more diverse and inclusive markets, and the expanded availability of credit. New entrants,",,
"from challenger banks to ﬁntech lenders, can improve the range of products and the appetite for risk in",,
"a market that includes banks, MFIs, supply chain ﬁnance providers, and others. Regulatory and super-",,
visory frameworks can support healthy innovation by allowing diverse lenders with modern business,,
models to participate in the market.,,
The entry of new ﬁnancial service providers may require adjustments in the regulatory perimeter.,,
"Digital credit providers, for example, oﬀer products similar to those provided by regulated banks, but",,
may not be subject to oversight by the ﬁnancial regulator because of the current deﬁnitions of regulated,,
activities or institutions.83,,"For example, in Kenya between 2016 and 2019, the providers of app-based,"
"short-term, small-value loans operated outside of the regulatory perimeter. During those years, use of",,
these products expanded from 0.6 percent to 8.3 percent of adults and resulted in instances of irrespon-,,
sible lending.84 This is one example of a new provider playing an important role that should be encour-,,
"aged, but also overseen within an expanded regulatory perimeter.85 Regulators worldwide are developing",,

capacity and assessing their approaches to regulating institutions and activities to accommodate the,,,,,,,,,,,
"entry of new providers on a level playing ﬁeld, while ensuring soundness, ﬁnancial integrity, consumer",,,,,,,,,,,
"protection, and inclusion.",,,,,,,,,,,
Rapid innovation and shifts to new providers and infrastructure can pose risks to stability.86,,,,,,,,,,Some,
"promising approaches to managing these risks include expanding the regulatory perimeter, deploying",,,,,,,,,,,
"diﬀerentiated licensing requirements proportionate to the risks presented by a product or provider, ",,,,,,,,,,,
and introducing activity-based regulation. New guidance is also emerging from the global standard- ,,,,,,,,,,,
setting bodies.87 ,,,,,,,,,,,
"The need for well-designed regulatory and supervisory frameworks applies not just to new entrants,",,,,,,,,,,,
"but also to all providers to encourage sound experimentation with new channels, products, and pro-",,,,,,,,,,,
cesses. Regulatory or supervisory restrictions could impede revisions of risk models to adapt to sec-,,,,,,,,,,,
"toral shifts and new economic conditions, as well as the adoption of new technologies, products, and",,,,,,,,,,,
processes needed to adapt to changing postpandemic markets. There is scope to provide more latitude,,,,,,,,,,,
"for experimentation and innovation without sacriﬁcing institutional or systemic soundness, such as by",,,,,,,,,,,
allowing innovative products or business models to be deployed within a given risk envelope or expo-,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure limit. For example, in 2018 the Bank of Thailand indicated a move from speciﬁc product reviews to",,,,,,,,,,,
umbrella approvals covering a range of related products or setting exposure thresholds.88 ,,,,,,,,,,,
New regulatory approaches to spur innovation will naturally require that regulators build their own,,,,,,,,,,,
internal capacity to understand new technologies and monitor the market to ensure that experimenta-,,,,,,,,,,,
"tion is consistent with the broader goals of a stable, productive ﬁnancial sector. Regulatory innovation",,,,,,,,,,,
hubs and sandboxes can help regulators be digitally informed and narrow the gap between regulation,,,,,,,,,,,
and ﬁnancial innovation. A survey of regulators in 2020 found that 16 percent had introduced regula-,,,,,,,,,,,
"tory sandbox initiatives, while about 36 percent had accelerated deployment during the pandemic.89 ",,,,,,,,,,,
Supervision technologies (suptech) can also enable supervisory agencies to monitor a broader and,,,,,,,,,,,
more complex ﬁnancial sector more efficiently.90,,,,,,Just as ﬁnancial service providers are reaping gains,,,,,
"from technology, regulators and supervisors can embrace technology to improve market surveillance,",,,,,,,,,,,
"enforce market conduct and consumer protection standards, and better respond to complaints. During",,,,,,,,,,,
"the pandemic, many supervisors either accelerated or introduced new suptech initiatives.91 Technology",,,,,,,,,,,
"can also lower the cost to collect and analyze data for regulators, to identify potential discrimination in",,,,,,,,,,,
"lending practices, and to inform policy design. The example of Chile92 indicates that consideration can",,,,,,,,,,,
"be given to producing anonymized gender disaggregated data for the ﬁnancial sector, with the goal of",,,,,,,,,,,
"capturing diﬀerential developments in borrowing and credit risk, identifying potential discrimination",,,,,,,,,,,
"in lending practices, and informing market and policy eﬀorts to close the gender gap in credit access.",,,,,,,,,,,
"The bigger role of data, coupled with advanced analytics enabled by machine learning and AI, also",,,,,,,,,,,
requires new regulatory and supervisory policies. Financial institutions will provide some of the data,,,,,,,,,,,
used to measure risk during and after the pandemic. Other data will come from third parties such as,,,,,,,,,,,
"credit bureaus, utilities, employers, and government databases. Data governance frameworks will be crit-",,,,,,,,,,,
"ical for deﬁning the rules around data ownership and use. For example, a rights-based data governance",,,,,,,,,,,
framework can enable data sharing while protecting against misuse.93,,,,,,,,Fair lending frameworks should,,,
encompass algorithmic accountability and transparency to reduce the chances that bias becomes hard-,,,,,,,,,,,
wired into AI-based decision models (see box 4.2 earlier in the chapter). Several jurisdictions are crafting,,,,,,,,,,,
policies for algorithmic transparency and accountability.94 Regulation should address the ownership of,,,,,,,,,,,
"and access to data, protection of data (including cybersecurity), and potential bias in data analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,
Adoption,of,emerging,technologies,such,as,cryptocurrency,and,decentralized,ﬁnance,will,also
require new regulatory frameworks. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies do not appear to be,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,LENDING DURING THE RECOVERY AND BEYOND,,,,|,185
positioned to play a signiﬁcant role in access to credit during the near-term pandemic recovery. But,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"applications such as remittances and central bank digital currencies are being deployed, and the under-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
lying distributed ledger technology could have applications in capital markets and credit markets and as,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foundational infrastructure for permissioned sharing of validated data such as identity or credit history.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These technologies bear monitoring from ﬁnancial regulatory and market conduct perspectives, with",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Operationalizing,,,advances,in,"technology,",new,"products,",alternative,"data,",and,data,protection,

Improving financial sector infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Financial infrastructure comprises the legal and regulatory frameworks and public and private sector,,,,,,,,,,,,,
institutions and practices that support the efficient and sound functioning of the ﬁnancial systems. This,,,,,,,,,,,,,
infrastructure must also keep pace with digitalization to support the evolving needs of lenders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Digital,,"identity,",an,important,element,of,ﬁnancial,"infrastructure,",can,enable,broader,access,to
ﬁnance while maintaining system integrity. A recent study revealed that 49 percent of surveyed reg-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ulators implemented measures related to eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) and digital identity,,,,,,,,,,,,,
during the pandemic. Examples include digital contracts and signatures to support access to and resil-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ience of ﬁnancial services.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Payment systems are another key element of ﬁnancial infrastructure. The physical infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"used by clearinghouses and switches, as well as the soft infrastructure of rules and practices on partici-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pation, origination, recission rights, and ﬁnality, must be modernized to cope with the digital transfor-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
mation of ﬁnance and the shift away from cash accelerated by the pandemic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Credit infrastructure includes the hard infrastructure of asset registry systems and credit bureau,,,,,,,,,,,,,
databases and the soft infrastructure of laws and institutions designed to support efficient and respon-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sible allocation of credit in the economy. Together, they reduce lending costs and frictions and facili-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
tate access to credit.97,,,"For the data-driven innovations discussed in this chapter to be broadly usable,",,,,,,,,,,
lenders must be able to access and integrate a wider range of data into their underwriting models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Credit bureaus such as Creditinfo, CRIF, Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and TransUnion are working",,,,,,,,,,,,,
toward expanding access by leveraging technology to incorporate alternative data to enrich their data,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sets (see box 4.8). Regulators must also update their credit information-sharing regimes to guarantee,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the safe use of alternative data.98,,,,,Credit information system regulations that guide credit bureaus ,,,,,,,,
and,registries,should,ensure,that,nontraditional,lenders,also,have,access,and,report,their,credit
exposures because a gap in reporting by any set of lenders renders the credit information system less ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"valuable to everyone. The People’s Bank of China, for example, granted alternative lenders access to its",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another form of infrastructure that can facilitate access to credit during and after the pandemic,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is the laws and registries that allow lenders to accept innovative forms of collateral, such as movable",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of credit markets to reach and serve businesses and households—including micro- and small,,,

"Governments and regulators should support sound innovations in ﬁnancing, particularly those for",,,
MSMEs and vulnerable segments; facilitate upgrades in data-driven underwriting; encourage product,,,

Introduction,,
The impacts of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) crisis on sovereign debt are unusual in the speed and global,,
synchronicity of the surge in debt levels. If the economic recovery from the pandemic is delayed or fal-,,
"ters, the buildup of sovereign debt will threaten debt sustainability in many emerging economies, and",,
could produce longer-term economic and social consequences that look very similar to those of debt,,
crises in the past.,,
"Many emerging economies entered the pandemic with record levels of sovereign debt,1",,and they
took on additional debt to pay for programs aimed at limiting the economic and human costs of ,,
the pandemic. This was a practical choice driven by limited options: increasing taxes in a struggling,,
"economy is not viable, and reducing other public spending is, in most cases, not sufficient to cover ",,
the magnitude of additional ﬁnancing needs. The resulting debt burdens will have to be managed,,
carefully to prevent them from becoming a drag on the economic recovery.,,
Managing and reducing elevated levels of sovereign debt is crucial to ensure a strong and equitable,,
recovery. Sovereign debt crises are costly for sustained growth. One study ﬁnds that every year a country,,
remains in default reduces its GDP growth by 1–1.5 percentage points.2 High levels of sovereign debt also,,
have signiﬁcant social costs. They reduce the government’s ability to spend on social safety nets and,,
"public goods such as education and public health, which can worsen inequality and human development",,
"outcomes. When debt sustainability problems are not resolved, they tend to worsen over time because",,
the choices of each government constrain the options of future governments as more revenue is directed,,
to debt service. Sovereign debt crises also frequently coincide with other types of economic crises— ,,
"such as ﬁnancial sector crises, rising inﬂation, and output collapses—that have far-reaching negative",,
consequences for poverty and inequality.3,,
"Importantly, debt dynamics, ﬁnancing opportunities, and options to manage debt diﬀer signiﬁcantly",,
between emerging and advanced economies.4,,"For example, advanced economies tend to have better"
"market access and ﬁnancing options. They are also able to rely more heavily on domestic borrowing, and",,
"many can issue debt in their own currency and at diﬀerent maturities, which facilitates borrowing and",,
debt management. There are also important diﬀerences in the ability of advanced and emerging econ-,,
"omies to service debts. Many observers have noted that since the 2007–09 global ﬁnancial crisis, eco-",,
"nomic growth globally has remained above the eﬀective interest rates on sovereign debt, thereby keeping",,
"debt service burdens manageable.5 However, this observation masks important diﬀerences across coun-",,
tries. Although interest payments in advanced economies have been trending lower in recent years and,,
"account, on average, for only around 1 percent of GDP, the cost of interest payments for emerging econ-",,
"omies has been rising steadily, and reached nearly 8 percent of GDP in 2020.6 ",,
This chapter examines the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on sovereign debt. It documents the ,,
sharp increase in sovereign debt stemming from the crisis and charts the options available to policy,,
"makers to manage dramatically increased debt burdens, while diﬀerentiating between countries based",,
on characteristics such as market access and income levels.7,,Learning from past experience is essential
to inform the policies governments will need to adopt to address debt sustainability concerns as the,,
"immediate eﬀects of the COVID-19 pandemic begin to recede. To this end, this chapter highlights the",,
"importance of addressing debt sustainability problems promptly and proactively, as well as the substan-",,
tial economic and social costs of delayed action.,,
The impact of COVID-19 on sovereign debt,,
"The COVID-19 crisis led to a dramatic increase in sovereign debt, with average total debt burdens among",,
"low- and middle-income countries increasing by roughly 9 percent of GDP during 2020, compared with",,
an average of 1.9 percent of GDP per year over the previous decade.8,,
204,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
"This increase in debt burdens has serious implications, especially for low-income countries, whose",,,,,,,,,,,
"ﬁnancial position had already been deteriorating before the pandemic. Between 2019 and 2020, the aver-",,,,,,,,,,,
age domestic and external debt stock of low-income and lower-middle-income countries increased by,,,,,,,,,,,
"roughly 7 percent of GDP (ﬁgure 5.1). Over the same time period, the average debt stock of countries",,,,,,,,,,,
eligible for the Group of Twenty (G20) Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) increased from 50 to ,,,,,,,,,,,
"57 percent of GDP. By 2019, half of the countries in this group were in debt distress—that is, unable",,,,,,,,,,,
to meet their ﬁnancial obligations to creditors—or at high risk of debt distress (ﬁgure 5.2).9,,,,,,,,,,This trend,
accelerated after the onset of the pandemic and was poised to accelerate further with the expiration of,,,,,,,,,,,
DSSI in December 2021.10,,,,,,,,,,,
Sovereign debt burdens are unlikely to decrease in the near future because they are the combined,,,,,,,,,,,
result of large ﬁscal support programs necessary to mitigate the worst eﬀects of the pandemic and the,,,,,,,,,,,
contemporaneous collapse in government revenue due to the global slowdown in economic activity.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tax revenue as a share of GDP, for example, declined in 96 of the 133 low- and middle-income countries",,,,,,,,,,,
in 2020.11,The costs of the pandemic are far exceeding the amount of money countries can easily shift,,,,,,,,,,
from other areas of their budgets; countries that have access to credit markets have taken on new debt,,,,,,,,,,,
to ﬁnance emergency expenditures.,,,,,,,,,,,
"The prospect of a slow recovery places further pressure on government budgets, even as the immediate",,,,,,,,,,,
"eﬀects of the pandemic subside. During an economic crisis, governments can and often do function as the",,,,,,,,,,,
"lender of last resort for ﬁrms and households, which means that private debts can quickly become public",,,,,,,,,,,
"debts in a large, protracted economic crisis. When an economic crisis threatens the survival of economi-",,,,,,,,,,,
"cally important sectors and ﬁrms, governments have often taken on signiﬁcant additional debt to stabilize",,,,,,,,,,,
those sectors or ﬁrms. Some of the debt-ﬁnanced stimulus programs implemented during the COVID-19,,,,,,,,,,,
crisis are examples of how governments step in to absorb economic risks when the private and ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,
"sectors are unable to do so. If successful, the stimulus should result in economic growth and the delever-",,,,,,,,,,,
"aging of private borrowers. However, such a solution comes at the cost of higher public debt burdens.12 ",,,,,,,,,,,

The human costs of debt crises,,,
Managing and resolving elevated levels of sovereign debt are essential to ensuring an equitable recov-,,,
ery from the COVID-19 crisis. Long-lasting debt distress has far-reaching negative consequences for,,,
the economy and population. These consequences are typically borne disproportionately by vulnerable,,,
"populations, low-income households, and small businesses, and tend to worsen pre-existing poverty and",,,
inequality.,,,
Sovereign debt crises aﬀect human development in many ways because they rarely occur as an iso-,,,
lated event and often are only one component of a conglomerate crisis aﬀecting multiple sectors of the,,,
economy.18 Debt distress or default often coincide with a myriad of economic problems that may include,,,
"output collapses, ﬁnancial crises, currency crashes, and high inﬂation, which disproportionately aﬀect",,,
"the poor. Though the initial crisis trigger and order of events may diﬀer, conglomerate crises have larger",,,
economic and human costs than crises conﬁned to one sector of an economy. Because the COVID-19,,,
"pandemic simultaneously weakened private sector, ﬁnancial sector, and government balance sheets (and",,,
"weakened the ability of governments to mitigate spillover risks), many countries are at risk of experienc-",,,

Evidence shows that sovereign debt crises are often associated with large output collapses that have,,,

The COVID-19 crisis has played out against the backdrop of a rapidly changing market for sovereign,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"debt, characterized by the increasing complexity in creditor composition and the legal structures used",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to issue debt. This situation has reduced the transparency of sovereign debt and made it more difficult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for governments to manage, renegotiate, and restructure their debt when debt sustainability problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
become apparent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,One of the most signiﬁcant developments is the increase in the type and number of creditors. As of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2020, countries eligible for the G20 DSSI had, on average, more than 20 distinct creditor entities (exclud-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"contracts contain expansive nondisclosure clauses, making it difficult for other creditors to reliably",,,
assess the true ﬁnancial position of the government or the seniority of one creditor’s claim on the gov-,,,
ernment relative to those of other creditors.29,"However, concerns about transparency are not limited ",,
to government loans with non–Paris Club creditors. Debts taken on through SOEs or using legal forms,,,
not typically recognized as debt have also added to the difficulty of assessing the full extent of sovereign,,,
"liabilities.30 Not only does this complicate debt resolution in the event of a crisis, it also may deter lenders",,,
from oﬀering loans to countries in the ﬁrst place.,,,
"These issues extend beyond the central government. In many emerging economies, subnational",,,
" entities, such as SOEs or regional governments, also enter into external credit arrangements. Between",,,
"2009 and 2019, debt issuance by SOEs and subnational entities grew sevenfold, to about $140 billion.31 ",,,
Such borrowing by SOEs creates a risk of contingent liabilities that may not be reﬂected in government,,,
accounts because the debts of SOEs are often not fully integrated into the public sector’s balance sheet.,,,
"Moreover, not all liabilities of SOEs are structured in ways that make them recognizable as debt, which",,,
further obfuscates the true ﬁnancial position of the sovereign. This approach to liabilities can give rise,,,
"to signiﬁcant hidden risks (discussed in more detail later in this chapter), and it is especially important",,,
"in the current context in which many SOEs are directly aﬀected by the pandemic. Public utilities, for",,,
"example, have seen a dramatic decline in revenue stemming from moratoria on utility payments or the",,,
inability of customers to pay their bills.,,,
There has also been a shift in the type of legal structures used to issue sovereign debt. New debt instru-,,,
ments and contractual innovations have proliferated to meet the needs of particular creditor-debtor,,,
"pairings. Speciﬁcally, secured lending, novel de facto seniority structures, complex guarantees, swap",,,
"lines, central bank deposits, and commodity-based lending structured as forward sales have become",,,
more popular over the last two decades.32 A recent report on debt transparency ﬁnds that commodity- ,,,
based lending represents 10–30 percent of external debt stocks for the median low-income country in,,,
the year following the signing of the commodity-based arrangement.33,This practice has become par-,,
"ticularly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, where this type of lending accounted for 10 percent of new",,,
borrowing from 2004 to 2018.34,,,
Although syndicated loans (loans issued by a small group of banks organized by an “agent” bank),,,
"were the dominant debt instrument in the 1970s and 1980s, they have since given way to bonds as the",,,
most prevalent instrument for sovereign debt from private creditors. This shift has direct consequences,,,
"for debt resolution. For example, because bondholders are more dispersed and more difficult to coordi-",,,
"nate than bank syndicates, every time a central government needs to seek debt treatment, a bondholder",,,
committee must form.35,It is also notable in today’s context that more than one bondholder committee,,
may form for any given restructuring. This increases coordination problems among debtors and further,,,
complicates the management of sovereign debt.,,,
While some contractual innovations can improve the ability of debtors to resolve disputes with,,,
" speciﬁc creditors, they can also hamper coordinated resolution eﬀorts. For example, certain creditor",,,
types have become reluctant to participate in broad restructuring initiatives because of their perceived,,,
unequal contractual treatment relative to others. One set of contractual innovations is aimed at improv-,,,
"ing the seniority and security of their claims, including through collateralization.36",Such innovations,,
can add signiﬁcant complexity for the sovereign borrower if debts need to be restructured. An analysis,,,
of this class of debt contracts found that they often include broader nondisclosure clauses than is typical.,,,
Such clauses obscure the true ﬁnancial position of the sovereign borrower and create signiﬁcant obsta-,,,
cles in negotiations involving multiple creditors.37 Although this class of contractual innovations has not,,,
been tested in the courts—and it is unclear whether they would prevail—the signaling eﬀect and cost of,,,

Managing sovereign debt and resolving sovereign debt distress,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eﬀective management of sovereign debt can reduce pressure on government ﬁnances, free up resources",,,,,,,,,,,,
"for urgent ﬁscal expenditures, and avert the large social and economic costs of a full-blown debt ",,,,,,,,,,,,
crisis.39,,This section reviews tools that governments can use to better manage elevated levels of ,,,,,,,,,,
sovereign debt and resolve distress when it materializes. It also looks at the longer-term policies ,,,,,,,,,,,,
and reforms that can make government ﬁnances more resilient to unanticipated shocks such as ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the one resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. At times, similar tools can be used for both managing",,,,,,,,,,,,
elevated levels of sovereign debt and for resolving debt distress. The diﬀerence is often the degree to,,,,,,,,,,,,
which the available tools are applied and which combination of available policy options is chosen.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The degree of relevance of these tools depends on countries’ individual circumstances—for exam-,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ple, their degree of market access and their income level—as well as macroeconomic factors such as",,,,,,,,,,,,
the exchange rate regime. Most of the options presented in what follows are applicable across the,,,,,,,,,,,,
"spectrum because the basic principles of timely recognition of the problem, negotiation, and burden",,,,,,,,,,,,
reduction are relevant to all types of debt.,,,,,,,,,,,,
A critical ﬁrst step is to identify a country's risk of falling into debt distress. International ﬁnancial,,,,,,,,,,,,
"institutions typically play a central role in providing debt sustainability analyses (DSAs),40 which are the",,,,,,,,,,,,
"basis for classifying debt risks and designing strategies for debt reduction. For example, DSAs are an",,,,,,,,,,,,
integral part of Paris Club debt restructurings and often play a key role in restructurings with private,,,,,,,,,,,,
creditors as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because a reliable DSA is the basis for successful debt management and debt reduction, it is critical",,,,,,,,,,,,
that such an analysis be based on accurate information as well as transparent and realistic assumptions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accurate assumptions are crucial in three areas. The ﬁrst is growth, comparing expected growth rates",,,,,,,,,,,,
"with historical growth rates and allowing for realistic worst-case scenarios, especially in fragile, low- ",,,,,,,,,,,,
"income,",,and,commodity-exporting,economies.,The,second,is,ﬁscal.,Assumptions,should,take,into
"account the expenditures needed to achieve development goals—such as reducing poverty, adapting to",,,,,,,,,,,,
"climate change, meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—as well as assumptions on the",,,,,,,,,,,,
amounts and terms of the debt instruments used to ﬁll future funding gaps. The third is realistic dis-,,,,,,,,,,,,
count rates. Assumptions should diﬀerentiate between debt due now and debt due in the future.41,,,,,,,,,,,To,
"do this, DSAs use present value estimates, which discount future payments by a given discount rate. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Unrealistic discount rate assumptions are often overlooked as a reason that expectations and reality,,,,,,,,,,,,
diverge. The use of overly optimistic discount rates that make the present value of a sovereign’s liabilities,,,,,,,,,,,,
look manageable can lead to surprises when the economic environment turns out to be less benign than,,,,,,,,,,,,
the forecast and insufficient relief if debt distress materializes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Managing sovereign debt,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Countries at high risk of debt distress, as opposed to countries already in debt distress, have a number",,,,,,,,,,,,
of policy options for making their repayment obligations more manageable. Sovereigns at high risk of,,,,,,,,,,,,
"default can, for example, modify the structure of their liabilities and the schedule of future payments",,,,,,,,,,,,
through negotiations with creditors and the eﬀective use of reﬁnancing tools—whether these creditors,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are private or official. In this way, proactive debt management can reduce the risk of default and free up",,,,,,,,,,,,
the ﬁscal resources needed to support the recovery from the pandemic.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Debt reproﬁling to temporarily free up ﬁscal resources,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the primary tools governments have at their disposal to manage debt pressures before they,,,,,,,,,,,,
"become untenable is debt reproﬁling. In debt reproﬁling, the sovereign issues new debt in order to change",,,,,,,,,,,,
214,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,
"its debt service proﬁle. Multiple characteristics can be targeted by such operations. Most commonly, debt",,,
reproﬁling operations modify the maturity or currency exposure of existing debt. This usually happens,,,
"in one of three ways: (1) new debt is issued, and the proceeds are used to retire old debt; (2) old debt is",,,
"exchanged for new debt (similar to a debt restructuring, but market-based); or (3) new debt is issued at",,,
the time of maturity of the old debt but has signiﬁcantly diﬀerent characteristics. The debt is thus rolled,,,
"over, but the emerging liability service proﬁle is diﬀerent and more advantageous for the borrower.",,,
"Debt reproﬁling could, for example, be helpful when a country has multiple loans that come due in",,,
the same year and would place an excessive strain on government ﬁnances. The sovereign could choose,,,
to issue new debt with a longer or more even maturity proﬁle that is easier to service. The sovereign,,,
would then use the capital raised from this new debt issue to retire some of the loans for which matur-,,,
"ities were bunched in the same year. More typically, the operation would retire debt maturing in the near",,,
"future and replace it with debt of longer duration. In recent years, some sovereigns have also begun to",,,
"issue amortizing bonds, which pay principal down at diﬀerent points of their life. Use of this method",,,
helps to manage debt service ex ante by spreading out debt payments over time.,,,
"Reproﬁling can also target currency composition, which is an important factor in debt sustainability,",,,
"irrespective of a country’s exchange rate regime. In this case, instead of changing the maturity of exist-",,,
"ing debt, the debt reproﬁling operation aims to retire existing debt in one currency by issuing new debt",,,
"in another currency. In a recent debt reproﬁling operation in Ghana, for example, a foreign currency",,,
bond was issued to partially retire domestic currency debt. The rationale for this choice was to take,,,
advantage of abundant hard currency liquidity to increase space in the aggregate balance sheets of the,,,
domestic ﬁnancial sector.42,"Of course, the risks of greater foreign currency debt exposure, particularly",,
"in the context of signiﬁcant currency depreciation, must be weighed against the costs of domestic debt",,,
service in a relatively shallow domestic market. Other operations can retire expensive debt if the sover-,,,
eign’s cost of funds has fallen in capital markets (see box 5.2 for an example).,,,
"The details of reproﬁling operations vary, depending on the characteristics of a country’s debt and",,,
debt service proﬁle. Although debt reproﬁling receives more attention when pursued with private cred-,,,
"itors, it is not uncommon for debt reproﬁling operations to involve official creditors. Thus this option is",,,
available to debtor countries whatever their creditor composition. Countries with access to bond mar-,,,
"kets are, in theory, in a better position to take advantage of debt reproﬁling, but they may also be more",,,
reluctant to do so to avoid risking a downgrade in their credit rating. Designing a reproﬁling operation,,,
that eﬀectively manages the risks associated with sovereign debt is not trivial and requires extensive,,,
"analysis, typically carried out by the country’s debt management office in conjunction with international",,,
ﬁnancial institutions and possibly other advisers.,,,
"Overall, a country seeking to reproﬁle its debt needs to ascertain whether realistic ﬁnancing options",,,
are available and whether the resulting changes to its debt proﬁle would be sufficient to solve the prob-,,,
lem. Although debt reproﬁling can free up liquidity and make a country’s debt payments more man-,,,
"ageable, it typically will not reduce the debt stock and is therefore not a long-term solution for debt",,,
sustainability issues.,,,
Preemptive negotiations with creditors to prevent debt distress,,,
Sovereigns that are at high risk of or are in debt distress have the option of initiating preemptive nego-,,,
tiations with their creditors to reach a debt restructuring before they fail to meet their contractual,,,
obligations.43,There are many historical examples of preemptive restructurings aimed at averting out-,,
"right default, including Chile (1987 and 1990), Algeria (1992), the Dominican Republic (2005), and, most",,,
"recently, Ukraine (2015–16) and Belize (2020).44 The option to pursue a preemptive restructuring depends",,,
"largely on the creditor’s willingness to negotiate, the debtor’s credibility, and agreement on the debtor",,,

"country’s needs. For countries with market access, these negotiations usually take the form of convening",,
"a meeting with bondholders. When these negotiations are pursued with official creditors, they take the",,
form of either separate bilateral negotiations or a meeting with multiple creditors that could be coordi-,,
nated by a group such as the Paris Club or an international ﬁnancial institution. Whatever the creditor,,
"pool, the objective is a reduction of the debt stock or some present value reduction of the debt burden",,
"through reduced payments, extended maturities, or extended grace periods.",,
"Evidence shows that where preemptive restructuring is undertaken, it is resolved faster than post-",,
"default restructuring, leads to a shorter exclusion of the country from global capital markets, and is asso-",,
"ciated with a lower decline in output.45 This option is not available to all governments, however, because",,
it requires a high level of transparency about who holds the country’s debts and on what terms. This is,,
important because a preemptive restructuring relies on debtors and creditors agreeing on the probability,,
of debt distress and reaching an agreement acceptable to all creditors.,,
Although this discussion suggests that countries can reap clear beneﬁts from renegotiating high debt,,
"burdens preemptively, the evidence also shows that preemptive restructuring does not make countries",,
more resilient to debt sustainability problems in the longer term. The probability of defaulting within,,
24 months following a restructuring does not diﬀer between countries that pursue preemptive versus,,
postdefault restructuring (the relapse probability is 39 percent in both strictly preemptive and strictly,,
postdefault restructuring).46 This ﬁnding suggests that in the future countries should use the improved,,
breathing space and stability oﬀered by preemptive restructuring to more rapidly lay the foundation for,,
longer-term debt sustainability.,,
Resolving sovereign debt distress,,
Once a government is in debt distress—most often marked by a default—the options to treat the problem,,
are more limited. The primary tool at this stage is debt restructuring. It requires prompt recognition of,,
"the true nature of the problem (sustainability), coordination with creditors, and an understanding by all",,
"parties that restructuring is the ﬁrst step toward debt sustainability (that is, reaching a level of debt that",,
allows the government to pay its current and future obligations).,,
These broad principles for sovereign debt restructuring are very similar to the principles for restruc-,,
"turing private sector debt covered in chapters 2 and 3, with a few important diﬀerences. First, there are",,
"no bankruptcy or insolvency courts for sovereign debt, which remains a signiﬁcant gap in the present",,
"ﬁnancial architecture. To restructure sovereign debt, there are, at best, creditor committees (such as",,
"the ones set up by the Paris Club, bondholders, or the London Club in the past) so debtors can meet to",,
"negotiate and come to an agreement. However, it is often a difficult, lengthy process to enforce such",,
"agreements or seize the assets of the debtor as in a regular commercial insolvency case. Typically, the",,
"assets of the sovereign are either covered by sovereign immunity (for example, central banks’ reserve",,
accounts with other central banks) or outside the jurisdiction of the courts adjudicating the contractual,,
"breach. With rare exceptions, only assets pledged as collateral and covered by clauses forgoing immunity",,
"are readily reachable by creditors. Second, despite the term",,"public debt, there is often a lack of informa-"
tion about a country’s lenders and the total amount of debt. Credit registries or credit bureaus track,,
"corporate debts. Although these databases may not be perfect, they tend to be more complete than the",,
information available on sovereign debt (see box 5.5 later in this chapter on the hidden debt problem).,,
"Third, sovereign debt restructuring involves lenders from diﬀerent countries, with the result that debt",,
contracts are often established under diﬀerent jurisdictions with diﬀerent instruments and diﬀerent,,
"levels of implied seniority. Although corporate debt can also have an international component, this is",,
"less common, especially in the case of micro-, small, and medium enterprises.",,

The importance of timely debt restructuring,,,,,,,,,,,
"When a country is unable to service its debt, there are strong arguments in favor of it quickly acknowl-",,,,,,,,,,,
edging the problem so it can take steps to reduce debt loads and allow for faster recovery. Evidence from,,,,,,,,,,,
"past debt crises shows that the average default spell lasts eight years,47 and the indebted country typically",,,,,,,,,,,
goes through two debt restructurings before it emerges from default (ﬁgure 5.6).48,,,,,,,,"Indeed, Jamaica and",,,
Poland each engaged in seven debt restructuring deals with private external creditors before resolving,,,,,,,,,,,
"their default spell so they are capable of ﬁnancing the necessary spending. Chad, one of the ﬁrst three",,,,,,,,,,,
"countries to apply for the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI (see box 5.3),",,,,,,,,,,,
is currently seeking its third debt restructuring since 2014. Such extended timelines have far-reaching,,,,,,,,,,,
"social and economic consequences in which development goals suﬀer signiﬁcant setbacks, delaying an",,,,,,,,,,,
equitable recovery. This is part of the post–COVID-19 reversal problems many low-income countries are,,,,,,,,,,,
already experiencing (see box 5.1).,,,,,,,,,,,
"The resolution of sovereign debt distress can be a lengthy process for several reasons. First, the",,,,,,,,,,,
increased importance of new types of lenders impedes transparency and makes it more difficult to estab-,,,,,,,,,,,
"lish the true extent of a country’s outstanding debts, which complicates the coordination of diﬀerent",,,,,,,,,,,
"creditors. Second, governments are often tempted to delay debt restructuring for strategic or political",,,,,,,,,,,
"reasons. In addition, creditors are often reluctant to grant debt relief that is extensive enough to perma-",,,,,,,,,,,
"nently solve a country’s debt sustainability problem. Although the explanations vary case by case, the",,,,,,,,,,,
common outcome is that the initial restructuring is often delayed and falls short of what is necessary to,,,,,,,,,,,
achieve debt sustainability.,,,,,,,,,,,
One,common—and,misguided—approach,is,to,postpone,debt,resolution,eﬀorts,until,economic,
"conditions improve.49 However, such a strategy can itself deepen and prolong an economic downturn",,,,,,,,,,,
because the unresolved debt crisis prevents a country from recovering capital inﬂows. Creditors and,,,,,,,,,,,
debtor governments should thus view debt restructuring as part of the initial resolution and recovery,,,,,,,,,,,
"plan rather than as a subsequent step, as is often the practice for private debt.",,,,,,,,,,,
Sovereign debt restructuring typically involves ﬁve steps:,,,,,,,,,,,
1,The debtor country announces its intention to pursue an agreement with one or several of its key,,,,,,,,,,

2,"Creditor committees are formed (if no standing committee exists), and conversations are initiated.",,,,,,,,,,
3,"The debtors, creditors, and their respective advisers take inventory of the existing claims against",,,,,,,,,,

increase their human and economic costs. Data from recent studies suggest that more than half of the,,,
debt restructurings that ended a default spell included a reduction in face value.50 ,,,
The role of insufficient debt reduction in future defaults,,,
One reason why countries typically require several rounds of debt restructuring to emerge from debt,,,
distress is that creditors often ﬁnd it difficult to agree to restructuring deep enough to make debt bur-,,,
dens sustainable and future default unlikely.,,,
"From the creditor’s perspective, sovereign debt restructuring follows a simple logic: the restructuring",,,
should grant sufficient debt relief to ensure repayment but avoid reducing debt more than is strictly,,,
"necessary. For low-income countries, official lenders equate debt relief with aid, and so they may be",,,
"more willing to agree to larger debt reductions. However, the debtor country’s ability to service its debt",,,
"depends on a wide range of factors (such as economic growth, international economic conditions, and",,,
"the ability to raise tax revenue), which are difficult if not impossible to forecast at longer time horizons.",,,
"In this situation, it is tempting for lenders to buy in to overly optimistic forecasts because those forecasts",,,
"imply that smaller debt write-oﬀs are required to ensure debt sustainability in the future. In reality,",,,
"however, by relying on overly optimistic forecasts creditors systematically underestimate the amount of",,,
"debt reduction needed, thereby laying the foundation for future debt distress.",,,
"To avoid this common cause of prolonged debt distress and recurring rounds of default, creditors and",,,
"sovereigns need to agree on a set of realistic (ideally independently assessed) growth projections, which",,,
can provide the basis for a more reliable debt sustainability analysis.,,,
The importance of eﬀective creditor coordination to debt resolution,,,
Debt restructuring requires coordination between the sovereign and its creditors. Because there is typ-,,,
"ically one debtor and many creditors, a creditor committee is formed to facilitate the process and min-",,,
imize holdouts and litigation.51,Whether a restructuring is attempted preemptively or after distress has,,
"materialized, negotiating through a creditor committee is the most common approach to resolving sov-",,,
"ereign debt distress. Depending on the composition of the creditors, creditor committees can be made",,,
"up of multilateral, bilateral, and private sector creditors. Coordination problems are typically difficult",,,
"to resolve for any of these types, but historically multilateral and bilateral diplomacy between official",,,
creditors has helped (box 5.3).,,,
Because the growing importance of nontraditional lenders has obfuscated the full extent of coun-,,,
"tries’ debts and made creditor coordination more difficult, new solutions are needed to overcome coor-",,,
dination problems in debt negotiations. Past crises may oﬀer some guidance on how better coordination,,,
"between creditors can be achieved in a more complex market for sovereign debt. For example, commer-",,,
"cial creditors, which account for a growing share of sovereign debt, could be enticed to participate in",,,
"restructurings by their own governments. During the debt crises of the 1980s, US commercial banks",,,
"held substantial amounts of emerging market debt, especially in Latin America. Defaults on these assets",,,
"threatened to develop into a banking crisis in the United States,52 thereby giving the US government an",,,
"incentive to oﬀer bilateral debt relief. The result was the Brady Plan, named for US Treasury Secretary",,,

The high social and economic costs of liquidating sovereign debt without restructuring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Looking ahead: Reforms to mobilize revenue, improve",,,,,,,,,,,
"transparency, and facilitate debt negotiations",,,,,,,,,,,
The challenges of managing higher debt levels and resolving a rising number of debt crises in the after-,,,,,,,,,,,
"math of the COVID-19 crisis highlight the need for reforms that can facilitate revenue mobilization,",,,,,,,,,,,
"better debt management, debt negotiation, and access to capital markets in the longer term. This section",,,,,,,,,,,
"explores how improved transparency, as well as legal and tax reforms, can make sovereign debt markets",,,,,,,,,,,
more efficient and sovereign balance sheets more resilient.,,,,,,,,,,,
Dependence of sovereign debt sustainability on mobilization of new tax revenue,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries saw a sustained rise in tax revenue—in lower-middle- ",,,,,,,,,,,
income countries tax revenue as a share of GDP increased from 17 percent to 22 percent between 2000,,,,,,,,,,,
and 2019.62,"Half of this revenue growth came from indirect taxes (especially the value added tax, VAT),",,,,,,,,,,
"30 percent from direct taxes on income, and 20 percent from payroll taxes. This upward trend in revenue",,,,,,,,,,,
"mobilization was driven by the greater efficiency of tax administrations, technological innovations, and",,,,,,,,,,,
improvements of tax designs.,,,,,,,,,,,
Can governments continue to increase tax revenue over the next decade? The COVID-19 pandemic,,,,,,,,,,,
"has created a short-term but drastic revenue shortfall, but it could reinforce revenue mobilization in",,,,,,,,,,,
the medium term by legitimizing the role of the state as a provider of insurance and redistribution.,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, there are no magic bullets—higher tax revenue arises principally from long-term investments",,,,,,,,,,,
in tax capacity and from structural changes in countries’ economies bolstered by international eﬀorts,,,,,,,,,,,
to address tax avoidance. Three areas of reforms can nonetheless raise revenue while balancing equity,,,,,,,,,,,
"and efficiency considerations. However, progress on mobilizing new tax revenue may be threatened by a",,,,,,,,,,,
"delayed or anemic recovery or social backlash, as was seen recently in Colombia.63",,,,,,,,,,,
"First, governments increasingly have the capacity to target high earners with progressive taxes. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"Currently, in low- and middle-income countries personal income taxes and property taxes account for",,,,,,,,,,,
"only a small share of GDP (3 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively), which is a much lower share than in",,,,,,,,,,,
high-income countries. The long-run transition from self-employment to employment in ﬁrms is a key,,,,,,,,,,,
"enabler of modern personal income taxes. However, this evolution in employment structure must be",,,,,,,,,,,
accompanied by investments in a tax administration’s capacity to target high earners and to tax their,,,,,,,,,,,
income from all sources (including capital) at rising marginal tax rates. Thus the tax eﬀort is borne,,,,,,,,,,,
principally by those with the means to contribute.64,,,,,Taxes on property are another progressive source,,,,,,
"of revenue. But despite a visible tax base, the current revenues are low. As urbanization drives property",,,,,,,,,,,
"values up in many cities, modern property registries, documented and accessed by means of technology,",,,,,,,,,,,
make real estate valuation and administration easier. Thus taxes on personal income and property are,,,,,,,,,,,
an untapped source of government revenue and simultaneously can help curb inequality.,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second, structural changes arising from the digitalization of economies and the climate emergency",,,,,,,,,,,
present not only challenges but also opportunities to mobilize revenue. As transactions go digital and,,,,,,,,,,,
taxpayers,ﬁle,"electronically,",tax,administrations,can,compare,self-reported,economic,activity,with,
"third-party reports to uncover discrepancies and better target audits. Similarly, large online platforms",,,,,,,,,,,
that aggregate transactions can be used as withholding agents and as mechanisms to formalize smaller,,,,,,,,,,,
ﬁrms that want to participate in online markets. Another key evolution is related to the climate emer-,,,,,,,,,,,
gency; it justiﬁes taxes aimed at limiting energy consumption and could raise additional tax revenue.,,,,,,,,,,,
Policy responses could take the form of removal of energy subsidies and the imposition of fuel taxes,,,,,,,,,,,
"or more ambitious carbon taxes. Whatever their shape, taxes must be tailored to each country’s tax",,,,,,,,,,,

capacity and energy structure and compensate vulnerable households for any increases in their tax bur-,,
den.65 Better use of health-related taxes (such as taxes on the consumption of alcohol and tobacco) could,,
also add more resources to the public purse while aligning personal incentives with a reduction in the,,
pressure on public health systems.,,
"Third, the design of taxes can be simpliﬁed to improve their transparency and efficiency. The princi-",,
pal tax instruments (the VAT and corporate and personal income taxes) are riddled with tax exemptions,,
"and tax credits. By narrowing tax bases, exemptions reduce revenue collection and the efficiency of taxes",,
"and provide opportunities for tax avoidance. Although some tax exemptions are justiﬁable, other gov-",,
ernment tools might be more appropriate to address the underlying issues. A contentious example is the,,
"removal of exemptions from the VAT base. Typically, products such as food and energy are minimally",,
"taxed or not taxed at all to introduce progressivity. However, exemptions also beneﬁt the rich, espe-",,
cially in countries where poor households mainly purchase goods in the informal sector.66,,Zero rating
goods is thus a coarse tax instrument for introducing progressivity. Conditional on compensating poor,,
"households through transfers, the removal of exemptions could be socially acceptable and would collect",,
revenue while also improving efficiency.67 ,,
"To follow the suggested path to tax reforms, governments will need to overcome political challenges",,
"and the opposition of interest groups. To achieve successful reforms, governments must build wide sup-",,
"port, clearly communicate the intended eﬀects, and compensate poor households for tax increases. Even",,
"then, it is difficult to gather support for even well-designed tax policies, such as removing tax exemp-",,
"tions. Such considerations might dictate the set of feasible reforms. Furthermore, where the informal",,
"sector is large, complementary policies to develop the private sector and expand the tax base are para-",,
"mount. Finally, because of the increased mobility of capital and of high earners, some tax revenue gains",,
will depend on greater international tax cooperation. Recent developments on the minimum taxation,,
"of multinational companies hold promise, but it remains unclear how these agreements will be applied",,
in practice and how much they will beneﬁt low- and middle-income countries.68,,
It is equally important to rationalize public expenditures and target public spending and investments,,
"eﬀectively. To set priorities for the allocation of public funds and to avoid inefficient spending, waste, and",,
"corruption, governments must have a well-designed public ﬁnance management system. Eﬀective public",,
ﬁnance management can also enhance the transparency of public expenditures and the accountability,,
of government officials. At a time when governments are pressured to increase health expenditures to,,
"address the eﬀects of the pandemic, a well-managed public expenditure process can make this task less",,
daunting.,,
The importance of transparency to debt management and resolution of,,
debt distress,,
Some of the main obstacles to the prompt recognition and resolution of sovereign debt distress stem,,
from opaque ﬁscal accounts and unreliable debt data. A prerequisite for expedient sovereign debt repro-,,
ﬁling and restructuring is creditors’ access to reliable granular information about the country’s overall,,
debt as well as the seniority (when applicable) of their own claim relative to that of other creditors.,,
Transparent data on a country’s sovereign debt help creditors and multilateral institutions arrive at bet-,,

228,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
Debt transparency has two main dimensions: transparency in debt reporting and transparency in,,
debt operations.69 For transparency in debt reporting—probably the best-understood dimension—exist-,,
"ing and new debt must be disclosed to the public in a timely, comprehensive manner. Transparency in",,
"debt operations refers to the process of entering a new debt contract or altering an existing debt contract,",,
which includes but is not limited to having a well-designed legal framework.,,
Recent studies and proposals related to the international debt architecture have emphasized the,,
 central importance of transparency in debt reporting to successful debt management. Building on,,
" earlier work by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), in 2019 the G20 endorsed ",,
a set of Voluntary Principles for Debt Transparency drafted by the Institute of International Finance ,,
"and targeting private sector lenders. Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and",,
Development (OECD) is in the process of developing a disclosure platform based on these principles.,,
These developments are a positive step toward further strengthening transparency in terms of both,,
"comprehensiveness and accessibility, but more can be done.",,
"Eﬀective, forward-looking debt management requires comprehensive disclosure of claims against the",,
"government, as well as the terms of the contracts that govern this debt. In practice, very few countries",,
"meet this standard of transparency. In the market for sovereign debt, contracts are often not made public,",,
"and some even include explicit nondisclosure clauses.70 In addition, it is often difficult to develop a com-",,
"prehensive picture beyond the central government, as this is typically the level of debt reporting. Unfor-",,
"tunately, the majority of low-income countries do not yet have consolidated public sector accounts.71",,
One important prerequisite for transparency in debt reporting and operations is therefore an unam-,,
biguous legal framework that clariﬁes which entities are authorized to contract debt that is enforceable,,
against the sovereign.72 This framework should also require debt contracts to be made public in a central,,
"repository. Although various government agencies can be signatories of sovereign debt contracts, the",,
claims arising from these contracts are ultimately enforced against the underlying sovereign state and,,
its population.,,
Some recent debt events have highlighted the problem of hidden or undisclosed debt and the pos-,,
sibility of legal disputes about whether a government and quasi-government entities have the author-,,
ity to enter into debt contracts. Clarifying which state-owned entities are authorized to contract debt,,
"on behalf of the government and which subnational entities can raise claims against the government,",,
"including through guarantees and debt exchanges, can signiﬁcantly facilitate debt management and",,
"reduce the risk of hidden debts, thereby helping to avoid costly and disruptive disputes. Such clariﬁcation",,
would also ensure that any domestic accountability mechanisms that may be in place have sufficient,,
"information to operate properly. However, it is important that these legal requirements be accompanied",,
by strong underlying institutions and by a domestic and international commitment to respecting those,,
"rules. Otherwise, even if the law clearly states who can approve debt contracts, the enforcement of those",,
"rules may be lacking, as in Mozambique (box 5.5).",,
"Improved debt transparency can also contribute to the adoption of debt instruments, such as state-con-",,
"tingent bonds, which are efficient for debtors and creditors, but remain underutilized. One example is",,
"GDP- or commodity-linked bonds, which generate variable returns that move with the business cycle",,
or commodity prices. Such bonds automatically reduce the burden on sovereign balance sheets during,,
"downturns and could also prove beneﬁcial for investors. At present, these instruments have been used",,
most commonly as value recovery instruments (securities that allow the creditor to share in the recovery,,
of the country if it agrees to restructure debt during times of distress). GDP-linked bonds were used in,,
"the 2015–16 Ukrainian debt restructuring. In the past, Nigeria and República Bolivariana de Venezuela",,
"have issued commodity-linked warrants. However, the willingness of creditors to enter into such con-",,
tracts depends heavily on reliable data on a broad array of ﬁnancial and economic indicators. Although,,

to identify the holders of a sovereign’s outstanding debt instruments could be extremely useful in avoid-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ing delays in debt restructuring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The role of contractual innovations in reducing coordination problems and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
facilitating debt resolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Several contractual innovations can help overcome coordination problems and speed up the resolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of sovereign debt. One innovation is collective action clauses (CACs), which could lead to faster resolu-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tion of sovereign debt restructuring and thus more stability.74 Preliminary studies have found that these,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clauses tend to reduce the presence of holdout creditors during restructuring. CACs that permit aggre-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gation, in which a majority of creditors can overrule a minority of holdout creditors, appear to be most",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eﬀective at achieving faster resolutions in restructuring negotiations.75 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, it may be too optimistic to assume that CACs are sufficiently embedded in debt contracts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to resolve debt crises in the near future. Indeed, it may be too early to claim that debt crises were in fact",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shortened by the introduction of the newest generation of CACs in 2014.76,,,,,,,,,,Recent analyses argue that,,,,
the sample on which preliminary ﬁndings were based is too recent and draws heavily from a period,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of relative moderation.77,,,"Moreover, shortening restructuring processes and shortening debt crises are",,,,,,,,,,,
"two diﬀerent concepts.78 First, historically bringing sovereign debt crises or default spells to an end has",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"required, on average, two restructurings.79",,,,,"Second, it is difficult to argue that enhanced CACs are the",,,,,,,,,
"secure, de facto market standard because only about half of the outstanding stock of sovereign bonds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is estimated to contain these features, and a substantial portion of this legacy debt stock is still at least ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Recent debt negotiations, such as the Argentine and Ecuadorian restructurings of 2020, highlight",,,,,,,,,,,,,

met.82,,"Unfortunately, like state-contingent contracts, only about half of outstanding debt contracts",,,,,,,,,,,
"carry enhanced CACs, and the share is even lower for low-income countries.83",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another type of contractual innovation that can accelerate debt resolution and shield countries from,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unanticipated increases in sovereign debt is state-contingent debt contracts that insure the borrower,,,,,,,,,,,,,
against disaster risk. Such contracts are especially useful as climate risks become more widespread. The,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recent debt restructurings of Grenada (2015) and Barbados (2018), for example, have included natural",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"disaster clauses. To be eﬀective, contingency triggers should be protected from manipulation or oppor-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tunism—that is, the terms of the contract (reduced debt service or access to additional liquidity) should",,,,,,,,,,,,,
be triggered by an objective and independently veriﬁable event. By reducing a country’s debt service in,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the event of an unanticipated shock, these types of contracts can free up ﬁscal resources when they are",,,,,,,,,,,,,
needed most. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic or future events that trigger an increase in,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sovereign debt, this safeguard could be especially useful for countries that are also exposed to height-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
ened risk of natural disasters or climate change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A ﬁnal set of legal developments that can potentially improve creditor coordination and speed up debt,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resolution are legal reforms that address problematic enforcement practices against states. Creditors,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"face legal and practical challenges when enforcing claims against a state. In response, speciﬁc creditors",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(such as holdouts and so-called vulture creditors), have eschewed collective negotiation in favor of indi-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
vidualized enforcement. This approach has jeopardized creditor coordination and payments to other,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ruptcy mechanism that could incentivize coordinated action, several national jurisdictions have taken",,,,,,,,,,,,,
legislative steps to address problematic credit enforcement practices. These have included proﬁt-capping,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"statutes for vulture fund lawsuits (United Kingdom, 2010) and legal protections for payment-clearing",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"platforms, such as Euroclear (Belgium, 2015). In addition, international bodies have formulated non-",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,for the recovery,
"The COVID-19 crisis has given rise to a wide range of new and elevated economic risks, some of which will only",,
become apparent with time. Few governments have the resources and political leeway to tackle all of these,,
challenges at once. Countries will need to identify the risks that pose the most immediate threat to an equi-,,
table recovery and prioritize their policy responses. This concluding chapter reviews the most urgent risks and,,
highlights global issues that may arise as countries recover from the economic repercussions of the pandemic,,
at diﬀerent rates.,,
,,Policy Priorities
Pursuit of the following priorities can help set countries on the path to a more equitable and sustained,,
economic recovery:,,
•,"Mobilizing resources for the recovery. In many low-income economies, high levels of sovereign debt",
,pose the most urgent threat to the recovery. Countries facing this scenario can free up resources for,
,the recovery through improved debt management.,
•,Safeguarding ﬁnancial stability.,"In middle-income economies, ﬁnancial sector risks tend to pose"
,a larger threat to the recovery. These countries should focus on identifying and resolving ﬁnancial,
,sector risks to ensure the continued provision of credit.,
•,Scaling back support in a transparent manner. Support policies should be withdrawn in a predictable,
,manner and scaled back ﬁrst for the most resilient households and ﬁrms to counteract the highly,
,regressive impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.,
•,Managing exposure to global economic risks that threaten an equitable recovery. These include ,
,interest rate and currency risks that are likely to arise as advanced economies scale back stimulus ,
,policies.,
•,Supporting the transition to a green economy.,Economic policies for the recovery should aim to
,support sustainable growth by facilitating the reallocation of resources to green sectors and business,
,models.,

Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic will aﬀect countries for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"many years to come. As the immediate impacts of the pandemic subside, resource-constrained govern-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ments will face the challenge of scaling back support policies in a way that does not threaten the recov-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ery. Because of uneven access to vaccines and economic fragilities predating the pandemic, emerging",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"economies, in particular, face the very real prospect of a slow crisis recovery. Mobilizing the resources",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"needed for proactive management and reduction of ﬁnancial risks arising from the crisis, as well as for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"longer-term structural reforms, is essential for a strong and equitable recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Report has examined the primary ﬁnancial and economic risks that have been exposed or exac-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In an ideal situation, governments would implement relevant policies for each of the priority areas dis-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tainability. However, few if any governments have the resources and political leeway to tackle all of these",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
challenges at once. Countries will have to decide which policy areas to prioritize and how to best allocate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scarce resources to support the recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This chapter oﬀers some guidance for doing that within a globally connected economy, taking a the-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
matic perspective on the options and trade-oﬀs available. The chapter emphasizes that the prompt rec-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tackling the most urgent sources of risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the main themes running through this Report is that the sectors of an economy are inter-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
connected through multiple mutually reinforcing channels. These links create pathways along which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"risks in one sector can aﬀect the wider economy. However, well-designed ﬁscal, monetary, and ﬁnan-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cial policies can counteract these risks, lead to positive outcomes across multiple areas, and support an ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
equitable recovery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Using the framework of interrelated risks laid out in this Report, countries that need to make difficult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
choices about how to prioritize resources for the recovery can identify both the risks confronting their,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
economy and where policy action is likely to be most eﬀective at reducing economic fragilities worsened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the pandemic. The areas in which the risks are the most pronounced and are most likely to be the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
source of damaging spillovers warrant the most attention. This is not to say that countries with a high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"degree of risk in one area should ignore the other areas, but rather to emphasize the importance of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
urgent action in the areas where the threats are highest or where a further accumulation of risks is more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
likely to create spillover risks for the economy as a whole.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A common scenario in low-income countries is that the formal banking sector primarily serves wealth-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ier, more resilient households and larger, more established businesses, while low-income households and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small businesses most severely aﬀected by the pandemic are less likely to have access to bank credit. As a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"result, the possibility of rising loan defaults is typically a less pressing issue in these countries. Moreover,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
252,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"borrowers in low-income countries tend to be more reliant on nonbank lenders, such as microﬁnance",,
"institutions, and so those countries might beneﬁt from guidance on regulating and supporting these",,
institutions (as discussed in spotlights 2.1 and 3.1).,,
"Yet in these same countries, deteriorating public ﬁnances threaten the ability of the government to",,
"support the recovery and pose a risk to the domestic ﬁnancial sector, which often holds large amounts ",,
of sovereign debt.1 Low-income countries also tend to face greater external threats to an equitable recov-,,
"ery. As high-income countries begin to recover from the crisis, low-income countries that borrow in",,
foreign currency face the risk that their debt payments and import costs will become more expensive,,
"as global interest rates rise and their local currencies depreciate. In this scenario, a focus on improved",,
sovereign debt management can help countries manage existing debt burdens and free up resources for,,
the recovery (as discussed in chapter 5).,,
"By contrast, addressing ﬁnancial sector fragilities is a more pressing policy priority for many ",,
middle-income economies. The ﬁnancial sector in these countries is typically more developed and,,
"therefore more exposed to household and small business debt. As outlined in chapter 1, income losses",,
arising from the pandemic have led to a sharp deterioration in the ﬁnancial health of households and,,
"ﬁrms, and could trigger a sharp rise in loan defaults. This could, in turn, threaten the capital position",,
"of many lenders. Thus, as outlined in chapters 2 and 3 of this Report, regulators in these countries",,
"should take steps to improve the resilience of the ﬁnancial sector, promote greater transparency of",,
"bank asset quality, and expedite the restructuring of bad debts.",,
"Overall, middle-income countries also introduced larger and more encompassing ﬁscal and ﬁnancial",,
"sector policies in response to the pandemic, including cash transfers, debt moratoria for households and",,
"ﬁrms, and credit guarantee schemes for businesses. In these countries, policy makers need to ensure that",,
"support measures are withdrawn in a careful, predictable manner to avert a wave of loan defaults that",,
will threaten ﬁnancial stability and create contingent liabilities for governments.,,
Managing domestic risks to the recovery,,
Scaling back the stimulus,,
"In the short term, resource-constrained governments face the challenge of scaling back ﬁscal support to",,
"households and ﬁrms without dampening the recovery. In many countries, direct payments to house-",,
holds and ﬁrms have served as the main pillar of the crisis response and were designed to protect the,,
livelihoods of economically disadvantaged groups—such as workers in the informal sector and those in,,
unskilled occupations—and the survival of businesses in the sectors most severely aﬀected by the crisis.,,
"However, few countries have the resources to maintain these policies in the longer term, and in many",,
cases countries will need to phase out support before economic activity has fully recovered.,,
"As governments withdraw stimulus programs, policy makers must balance equity and efficiency con-",,
"siderations. Support should, for example, be scaled back ﬁrst for ﬁrms that are ﬁnancially resilient and",,
"have access to credit and capital markets that can help bridge temporary liquidity problems. Similarly,",,
"for households support should be scaled back ﬁrst for those that are ﬁnancially resilient, while support",,
that protects the incomes and livelihoods of vulnerable populations that have been especially hard-hit,,
by income losses stemming from the pandemic should be kept in place until their recovery prospects,,
"have materially improved. It is, moreover, essential that the withdrawal of support policies is imple-",,
mented in a transparent and predictable manner to avoid adding to the economic uncertainty that is,,
already dampening economic activity.,,
POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE RECOVERY,|,253
Managing risks to government budgets,,
Governments will also need to mobilize new revenue to pay oﬀdebts incurred for the crisis response,,
and preserve their ability to support the recovery. The potential return to economic growth during,,
"the recovery will help. However, governments must also pursue complementary, longer-term struc-",,
"tural policies to increase their revenue base. Most emerging economies, for example, lack the insti-",,
tutional capacity to tax incomes and instead rely primarily on taxing consumption. This approach is,,
"highly inefficient—for example, in 2020 Mexico, which relies heavily on consumption taxes, raised only ",,
"18 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in tax revenue,2 while countries in the European Union,",,
"relying primarily on income taxes, raised 41 percent of GDP in tax revenue.3",,Taxing consumption 
"is also highly inequitable because it places a disproportionate burden on the poor, who spend most",,
"of their income on consumption. Taxing wealth through property, income, and capital gains taxes is",,
an underused revenue generation strategy in most emerging economies and could help mitigate the,,
adverse impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on poverty and inequality. Revenue mobilization strategies,,
"should also strengthen incentives for businesses to formalize, which brings additional beneﬁts such as",,
improved access to credit.,,
Managing risks to financial stability,,
"In many economies, the withdrawal of stimulus programs may also pose a threat to ﬁnancial stability.",,
Because many support programs will be scaled back before the incomes of households and businesses,,
"have fully recovered, regulators and ﬁnancial institutions should be prepared to address an increase in",,
loan defaults.,,
Chapters 2 and 3 discuss policies that can counteract these risks and reduce the likelihood of a ,,
credit crunch that would disproportionately aﬀect small businesses and low-income households and,,
could weaken the recovery. The policies discussed in chapter 2 focus on managing loan distress and,,
safeguarding ﬁnancial stability. Those featured in chapter 3 are aimed at improving and establishing a,,
well-functioning legal insolvency framework for households and businesses. Eﬀective policy action in,,
both areas can prevent the risks posed by loan defaults escalating to the point that banks reduce lend-,,
"ing. The challenges presented by elevated levels of nonperforming loans require a quick, comprehensive",,
policy response on the three main fronts laid out in chapter 2: (1) improving transparency on banks’,,
exposure to problem assets; (2) developing the operational capacity to address rising volumes of bad,,
loans to ensure the resolute and efficient handling of borrowers considered nonviable; and (3) providing,,
supervisors and bank resolution authorities with the tools they need to deal decisively with distressed,,
banks in a manner that protects taxpayers and ensures the continuity of key ﬁnancial services. Policies,,
should encourage timely action before nonperforming loans rise to problematic levels. Both regulators,,
and ﬁnancial institutions should therefore be prepared to address an increase in problem assets as sup-,,
port programs are withdrawn.,,
An important tool to help resolve high levels of private debts in the economy is a functioning legal,,
insolvency framework (see chapter 3). Because many emerging economies either lack legal or institu-,,
"tional frameworks for debt resolution or suﬀer from weak implementation or enforcement capacity,",,
they would likely see beneﬁts from concentrating eﬀorts in these areas—notwithstanding the fact that,,
"the legal reform process can be lengthy. Even in countries where institutional capacity is limited, small",,
"improvements in the bankruptcy code can make a diﬀerence. For example, the experience of several",,
emerging economies suggests that reforms that simplify bankruptcy proceedings can improve loan ,,
performance and increase the availability of credit.,,
254,|,WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2022
Ensuring continued access to credit for households and businesses,,
Many households and businesses are at acute risk of losing access to formal credit as a result of the,,
COVID-19 crisis. Such a loss could dampen the recovery because access to credit is an important insur-,,
ance mechanism that strengthens the ability of households and ﬁrms to weather economic risks that,,
might arise during an extended recovery (see spotlight 1.1 for a review of the evidence). Credit also,,
"ﬁnances investment and consumption, which are essential to support the recovery.",,
The ongoing economic disruptions and persistent economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic,,
have also increased credit risk and diminished the realizable value of collateral as well as other forms,,
of recourse for lenders. Coupled with the fact that government programs have had the unintended con-,,
"sequence of reducing credit market transparency, many lenders are ﬁnding it challenging to accurately",,
measure credit risk and have responded by tightening credit conditions across the board. Innovations in,,
ﬁnancial technology and lending models can help counteract the resulting contraction in lending and,,
stimulate continued lending to households and ﬁrms.,,
"Where lenders have sufficient liquidity but are reducing lending, new ﬁnancial technologies and lend-",,
ing models—often using alternative data sources to assess creditworthiness—can compensate for the,,
"lack of credit information. Similarly, better matching the duration of loan terms to the time horizon over",,
which lenders can assess credit risk can facilitate risk management in times of heightened uncertainty.,,
These advances can partly compensate for reduced credit market transparency and help lenders iden-,,
tify creditworthy borrowers. In situations in which lenders are reluctant to issue new credit because of,,
"economic uncertainty, governments and central banks could pursue other options such as partial credit",,
"guarantees. In these programs, often provided through state-owned banks, a guarantor (usually the gov-",,
ernment) absorbs part of the credit risk of loans to speciﬁc groups of borrowers. Although such programs,,
"require the lender to assume part of the credit risk, they must be implemented selectively (as discussed in",,
spotlight 4.1) because they can distort incentives for lenders to collect payments and borrowers to repay,,
credit. They also carry the risk of creating contingent liabilities for the government if borrowers default.,,
Managing interrelated risks across the global economy,,
"Beyond eﬀorts to support the domestic economy, governments must also consider developments in the",,
global economy that could pose a threat to an equitable recovery. Connections forged through global,,
"credit markets, international trade, foreign aid, and other areas create interdependencies. These con-",,
"nections have noticeably aﬀected the recovery, perhaps best illustrated by the disruption of vital global",,
"supply chains through the temporary shutdown of factories, shipping, warehouses, and other essential",,
infrastructure.,,
One important global risk is the uneven pace of recovery between advanced and emerging economies.,,
"The faster recovery in advanced economies is likely to precipitate an increase in global interest rates,",,
which will expose public and private sector borrowers to reﬁnancing risks and put downward pressure,,
on the currencies of emerging economies. These risks are especially acute for low-income countries with,,
"high levels of foreign currency–denominated debt, and they create a dilemma for the central banks of",,
"emerging economies. If they do not follow the interest rate hikes in advanced economies, they face the",,
"risk of capital outﬂows and a depreciation of the national currency. However, if they raise interest rates,",,
they risk dampening the domestic economy by exerting pressure on borrowers and increasing the cost,,
of servicing domestic sovereign debt.,,
"In view of these trade-oﬀs, a carefully chosen policy mix that addresses interest rates, exchange rates,",,
and macroprudential policy is crucial. This is especially important in countries with ﬁnancial sectors,,
POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE RECOVERY,|,255
that rely on credit and capital markets for wholesale ﬁnance because ﬁnancial institutions that cannot,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reﬁnance themselves will have less capacity to supply credit during the recovery. It should also be a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high priority in countries where state-owned enterprises account for a signiﬁcant share of the economy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When state-owned enterprises cannot reﬁnance short-term debt or service foreign currency debt, the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
risk of contingent liabilities for governments is even higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The recovery in emerging economies is also aﬀected by economic growth in the rest of the world, and",,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be impeded by slower growth in important emerging markets such as China. In view of China’s,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"role as the most important bilateral creditor for emerging economies, a protracted deleveraging of the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chinese banking sector could expose economies that previously borrowed heavily from China to sizable,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reﬁnancing risks (see chapter 5). Moreover, a slowdown in Chinese economic activity could aﬀect the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
economic recovery in emerging economies by reducing the global demand for their exports. For exam-,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ple, in 2020 China’s share of the total trade of Sub-Saharan Africa was 26 percent, or about equal to the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
combined shares of the European Union and the United States.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seizing the opportunity to build a more sustainable,,,,,,,,,,,,,
world economy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will call for far-reaching structural changes in economies,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around the world. This presents an enormous opportunity to accelerate the transformation to a more,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient and sustainable world economy. The consequences of climate change are already aﬀecting lives,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and livelihoods in all countries. Although climate change is a global phenomenon, its impacts are felt",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most severely in low-income countries and low-income communities, where they compound existing",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vulnerabilities such as lack of access to clean water, low crop yields, food insecurity, and unsafe housing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Governments and regulators have a variety of policy instruments at their disposal to support this,,,,,,,,,,,,
"transformation and adapt their economies to the realities of climate change, which is a major source",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of neglected risk in the world economy.5 Governments can, for example, use the tax code to incentivize",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"green investments, or central banks and supervisors could mandate higher risk provisioning for loans",,,,,,,,,,,,,
to sectors engaged in unsustainable activities that contribute to climate risks. Governments and central,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"banks can also provide ﬁnancing to lenders on preferential terms, conditional on meeting speciﬁc sus-",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tainability targets. Indeed, many countries have begun to use such regulatory incentives to accelerate",,,,,,,,,,,,,
the shift to a more sustainable economy. Such policies can have an important impact on the reallocation,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of ﬁnancing to green sectors and technologies. In China, for example, green lending targets as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,
